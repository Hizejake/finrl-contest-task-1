2021-04-07 12:00:00+00:00,8 Smart Ways to Analyze Crypto Token Before Investing in It,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/8-smart-ways-analyze-crypto-200000331.html,Entrepreneur,"The world of cryptocurrencies is vast and doesn’t revolve around Bitcoin and blockchain alone. There are over 5,000 cryptocurrencies on the market in existence today, according to crypto market capitalization aggregators, and more are being launched by the day — which makes it a bit challenging for Investors to decide on which to invest in.
In fact, there are many of them out there that aren't real. Scammers have seen the potential opportunities in the crypto space, and they’ve designed some tokens in order to get people’s money. Whether you're a beginner looking to invest in the crypto market or a seasoned investor, below are some techniques that will guide you in analyzing any token.

Note: Scammers are very smart, they are always out to lock into the endless opportunity surrounding crypto tokens; therefore, there are no perfect methods for analyzing crypto tokens. The following are just precautionary ways to help you analyze any crypto token — whether it is currency token, utility token or asset token — and also guide you in making a safe choice.
A token's whitepaper is where you'll find the team's aim for the project and the token's use cases. As such, it'll help you decide if realistic goals have been outlined
And even if you've found realistic goals, you need to be sure they weren’t lifted off the pages of another project's whitepaper. Because let's face it, the latter has happened time and again.
After having a good knowledge of the project's offering, the next step is to assess the team backing the project. Has anyone worked on reputable projects in the past? Are they reputable members of the blockchain ecosystem? What are their qualifications?
The goal of this assessment is to be confident you're investing in a token backed by people who actually know what they're doing. Consider this as a fundamental analysis that'll save you from investing in a company that's only out to cart away gains. But remember, images can easily be lifted off the internet.
A surefire way to invest in an ICO is to keep a close eye on the token's community on social media. Here, you'll get to know if the project has a large community supporting its cause. Facebook, Twitter, Telegram and Reddit would be a good place to start.

On the same note, you'll get to know what others are saying about the project and, thus, make informed decisions. Needless to say, there are bounties out there, whereby people are rewarded to make positive statements about the project. Hence, such reviews may be biased.
So you've found a great token’s ICO to invest in, but you're not allowed to participate due to your jurisdiction. You'd be breaking the law if you still forged ahead to make an investment.
That being said, you need to be sure that regulators in your country have not restricted participation in such offerings. Nevertheless, ICOs are still unregulated in a good number of regions, and regulators in some are working on more friendly rules.
Verifying this is another key factor you mustn’t miss when analyzing a token you are about to invest in because it determines the utility value of a token’s market value. So, as a smart investor, one question you should answer before investing in a token is this: What unique problem is this token solving?
Let’s take, for instance, Atayen Inc. It is redefining the advertising industry and especially the influencer sector with its SaTT solution, allowing anyone to be rewarded for their posts on social networks, with a platform developed at the cutting edge of technology. Another is Vinchain; it’s creating a worldwide blockchain database of used vehicle information that is 100 percent secure, transparent and accessible by all, and so on.
Practically, blockchain projects that uniquely solve a major problem will have more surge in demand, thereby boosting the tradable value of its token.
It's true you may have a lot of work on your hands, and may not always have the time to carefully scrutinize every project. If that's the case, it should not be at the expense of your money.
It'll be useful to follow trusted people in the cryptocurrency space. This should be experienced individuals who have good knowledge about the ecosystem and can give you sound advice. It'll save you from spending hours in front of the screen analyzing a project.
Related:Five Effects of COVID-19 on the Fintech Industry
You do not want to invest in a token and go to sleep, especially when your money is on the line. Therefore, it's good practice to follow the project on various social media channels. You'll find the latest announcements on these channels to keep yourself updated.
What's more, there's a Bitcoin Talk Forum and more forums where most projects publish announcements. And given that anyone is free to comment, you'll garner user sentiment pertaining to such news. It's also a good time to ask questions you may have on the Forum.
Timing is everything. It may come in last on the list, but it's just as important because choosing the best time to invest can impact on your return on investment. Accordingly, you need to know if it's the right time to invest in cryptocurrencies given that there are bear and bull markets.
At this time, it can be said that the market generally is on the boom. The same applies to consider if the ICO industry is on the boom.

2021-04-07 12:43:12+00:00,"Alcoa, Anheueser-Busch InBev, Rent-A-Center, Target and Walmart highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alcoa-anheueser-busch-inbev-rent-124312449.html,Zacks,"Chicago, IL – April 7, 2021 – Zacks Equity Research Shares of Alcoa Corporation AA as the Bull of the Day, Anheueser-Busch InBev SA/NV BUD as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Rent-A-Center, Inc. RCII, Target Corporation TGT and Walmart Inc. WMT.
Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:
It is easy for folks to forget that earnings season is right around the corner. We have had so much attention put on infrastructure bills and the small caps selling off, that it's tough to remember the Dow is at all-time highs and the rest of the market is rocking and rolling. Today's Bull of the Day is a stock that I feel will stand the test of time. It's a stock with a strong earnings history which has a great chance of hanging in there even when things go south.
Today's Bull of the Day is Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy)Alcoa.Alcoa, together with its subsidiaries, produces and sells bauxite, alumina, and aluminum products in the United States, Spain, Australia, Brazil, Canada, and internationally. The company operates through three segments: Bauxite, Alumina, and Aluminum.  In addition, it owns hydro power plants that produce and sell electricity to the wholesale market to traders, large industrial consumers, distribution companies, and other generation companies.
In addition to the favorable Zacks Rank, Alcoa has a Zacks Value Style Score of A, Growth of C, and Momentum of B to help it round out with a VGM Composite Score of A. The Metal Products – Distribution industry ranks in the Top 32% of our Zacks Industry Rank. There is good reason for the favorable rank. Over the last 30 days, four analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current year as well as next year. The bullish consensus has pushed up our Zacks Consensus Estimate from $1.47 to $3.33 for the current year while next year's number is up from 76 cents to $2.92.
There is no question that the market is screaming higher. Even the amateurs can make money in a market like this. Pick a four-letter ticker, load the boat and rejoice. It happens every day. It could be frustrating to see for some. When you have a stock that's not rocking and rolling in this market, it can be confusing. Why not my stock? Is there something I'm missing?
Today's Bear of the Day is a stock that has seen earnings move to the downside, which could spoil a rally. It's Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell)Anheueser-Busch InBev.Anheuser-Busch InBev engages in the production, distribution, and sale of beer, alcoholic beverages, and soft drinks worldwide. It offers a portfolio of approximately 500 beer brands, which primarily include Budweiser, Corona, and Stella Artois; Beck's, Hoegaarden, Leffe, and Michelob Ultra; and Aguila, Antarctica, Bud Light, Brahma, Cass, Castle, Castle Lite, Cristal, Harbin, Jupiler, Modelo Especial, Quilmes, Victoria, Sedrin, and Skol brands.
The reason for the unfavorable rank stems from recent earnings estimate revisions coming from analysts. Over the last 60 days, four analysts have cut their earnings estimates for the current year while three have followed suit for next year. The bearish moves have cut the Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current year from $3.27 to $3.02 while next year's number is off from $3.85 to $3.61.
The Beverages – Alcohol industry ranks in the Bottom 21% of our Zacks Industry Rank.
Rent-A-Centerstock has soared over the last 12 months and crushed Target, Walmart and many others during the past three years. The lease-to-own retailer also purchased a firm in February that sets it up to grow within the booming e-commerce LTO space.
Rent-A-Center is a lease-to-own retailer that sells furniture, appliances, TVs, and more. RCII's sales jumped 5.4% in 2020, driven by stronger growth in the second half of the year.
On top of that, the company announced in February it closed its purchase of Acima Holdings to help boost its e-commerce offerings, as the lease-to-own space becomes more popular in the digital commerce age.
Rent-A-Center's management has made a strong strategic move that Wall Street has loved so far. ""The acquisition dramatically increases our growth profile, and we believe we can achieve $6 billion in consolidated total revenue with mid-teens consolidated EBITDA margins in 2023 as we benefit from scale, profitability, and free cash flow generation,"" CEO Mitch Fadel said in prepared remarks.
Looking ahead, Zacks estimates call for RCII's revenue to soar 55% to reach $4.4 billion in fiscal 2021 and climb another 14% in FY22. Both of these would represent the company's strongest top-line expansion in almost 15 years.
Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings are projected to climb by 50% and 17%, respectively over this stretch. And the nearby chart shows how much stronger the company's earnings outlook has turned since its report and acquisition announcement.
RCII's strong positive EPS revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now. The stock also holds a ""B"" grade for Value and five of the seven brokerage recommendations Zacks has are ""Strong Buys."" Plus, RCII shares have soared 270% in the past year to outpace Shopify (SHOP) and it has skyrocketed 500% in the last three years.
The stock currently rests at around $59 a share to put it about 10% below its mid-March highs. And it sits near neutral RSI levels, which could give Rent-A-Center plenty of more room to run. On top of that, RCII's 2.1% dividend yield beats the 10-year U.S. Treasury's 1.7%, Walmart's 1.6%, and Target's 1.3%.
Blockchain and cryptocurrency has sparked one of the most exciting discussion topics of a generation. Some call it the ""Internet of Money"" and predict it could change the way money works forever. If true, it could do to banks what Netflix did to Blockbuster and Amazon did to Sears. Experts agree we're still in the early stages of this technology, and as it grows, it will create several investing opportunities.Zacks' has just revealed 3 companies that can help investors capitalize on the explosive profit potential of Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies with significantly less volatility than buying them directly.See 3 crypto-related stocks now >>

Castle Rock, CO, April 07, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --Riot Blockchain, Inc. (NASDAQ: RIOT) (""Riot”, “Riot Blockchain” or the “Company""), one of the leading Nasdaq-listed Bitcoin mining companies in the United States, today announced a large-scale contract for the purchase of 42,000 S19j Antminers for USD $138.5 million from Bitmain Technologies Limited (“Bitmain”). This purchase agreement represents a significant step forward in Riot’s strategic initiative to increase its Bitcoin mining hash rate, which is now estimated to reach 7.7 exahash per second (EH/s) once fully deployed. This level of growth represents a 93% increase over the Company’s previously estimated committed hash rate capacity of 4.0 EH/s by October 2021.
This purchase agreement significantly bolsters Riot’s projected growth. Riot is scheduled to receive a minimum of 3,500 S19j Antminers on a monthly basis starting in November 2021, and will continue through October 2022. The Company is currently receiving monthly shipments as scheduled through October 2021, from previous purchase agreements and this new order continues that growth trajectory.
“This long-term purchase order marks a major milestone in the continued expansion of Riot’s mining operations,” said Megan Brooks, COO of Riot. “Riot’s existing fleet of miners has already positioned the Company as an American leader in Bitcoin mining. By nearly doubling its planned hash rate capacity, Riot continues to take great strides forward in growing both the Company’s and the United States’ share of the global network hash rate. We are proud of this accomplishment and remain focused on continuing to evaluate additional opportunities in the space.”
Once fully deployed, Riot will have a fleet of approximately 81,150 Antminers, 95% of which will be the latest generation S19 series model. The S19j operates at 90 TH/s and consumes 3,100 watts of energy. With all miners fully deployed, the Company’s total fleet is expected to consume approximately 257.6 megawatts (MW) of energy with an overall hash rate efficiency of 33 joules per terahash (J/TH). This new purchase order continues to demonstrate Riot’s commitment as a market leader to building one of the most efficient Bitcoin mining fleets in the industry.
The Company notes the significance of securing a large scale purchase contract comprised of the latest-generation miners of this magnitude, especially during a period of scarce supply of Bitcoin mining hardware. The global shortage of semiconductor production combined with the recent increase in demand for Bitcoin mining has hampered the ability for many miners to grow their hash rate. Riot has enjoyed a positive, long-term relationship with market-leading mining hardware supplier Bitmain, having entered into nearly $230 million in purchase contracts for miners since late 2019.
“We are excited for our long-term cooperation with Riot as they continue to solidify their growth and position as one of the global leading companies in Bitcoin mining. With their new order of Bitmain’s next-gen Antminers, this will assure the rapid growth and long-term investment of their mining operations”, said Irene Gao, Antminer Sales Director of NCSA Region, Bitmain.

2021-04-07 13:05:27+00:00,"The story behind Heat arena’s new naming-rights deal. Also, when will it become FTX Arena?",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/story-behind-heat-arena-naming-130527392.html,Miami Herald,"AmericanAirlines Arena will soon become FTX Arena, but not just yet. Although Miami-Dade commissioners approved the 19-year deal worth $135 million for naming rights at the Miami Heat’s county-owned arena on March 26 and the NBA also recently approved the switch, the building’s name remains AmericanAirlines Arena for now. There’s no clear timetable for the name change, which will be the venue’s first name change since it opened in 1999 on New Year’s Eve, but Heat president of business operations Eric Woolworth made clear during a video interview this week that the planning behind the arena’s transformation is underway. The naming-rights deal agreed upon by the county and the FTX cryptocurrency exchange “will cover most of the same kind of signage that you saw that American [Airlines] had,” according to Woolworth. That includes stripping the iconic American Airlines airplane from the roof of the arena in favor of an FTX logo at some point, as FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried said during a video interview from Hong Kong (where FTX is based) this week that “I would be looking at the FTX logo as a pretty good guess at what might show up there.” The company’s logo is also expected to be on the Heat’s court, but Kia will remain as the logo on the court for now until the switch is made. “In terms of when you’re going to start to see things,” Woolworth added, “Sam and I would both tell you that we’re going to make sure we do this right. So we’re not going to rush and get something out there just for the sake of getting something out there. It would be great if we could get some things that people can see toward the end of the season and into the playoffs. But it will be the start of next season before we see the entire array of partnership assets unveiled.” In tandem with the county’s recent agreement with FTX, the Heat announced Wednesday it has also entered a long-term partnership with FTX.us, the company’s U.S.-based exchange that launched in 2020. The partnership makes FTX.us “the official and exclusive cryptocurrency exchange partner of the Miami Heat.” Story continues In a press release issued by the team to announce the news, the Heat said its home building located in downtown Miami will be known as FTX Arena “starting with the 2021-22 NBA season.” The release also describes FTX.us as “a leading US exchange where customers can trade Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies safely and securely. The company seeks to offer US traders a platform that inspires their loyalty, as well as expand access to a new generation of financial tools and services to people around the US and across the world. FTX.us believes that everyone needs a seat at the table when it comes to the future of money.” The partnership will give FTX.us “prominent in-arena signage, hospitality, association with Heat digital content series, promotions, contests, community engagements and more.” “FTX.us is an exciting, young company in an emerging category of the financial services industry that continues to grow at lightning speed, and we are ecstatic to welcome them with open arms to the Magic City,” Woolworth said in a statement. “This is a ground-breaking, first of its kind partnership in our industry that will draw global attention. And, while we pride ourselves on blazing a trail, we acknowledge that Mayor Daniella Levine Cava’s pragmatic approach and strong leadership has further bolstered the robust, enduring public/private partnership between the Heat and Miami-Dade County.” The Heat negotiated the naming-rights deal with American Airlines in the 1990s, but Miami-Dade exercised its option to take over naming rights in 2018 in exchange for guaranteeing the team a $2 million yearly payment starting in 2020. Finding a new sponsor for the arena was an uphill climb for Miami-Dade, sparking tension with the Heat in recent months. But Woolworth said the recent election of Levine Cava helped smooth over friction between the two sides. “We’ve obviously had some ups and downs,” Woolworth said of the Heat’s relationship with the county. “I would say last fall, the county’s efforts to sell the naming rights were somewhat in disarray. But Mayor Levine Cava’s election was a real turning point. Within the first couple weeks of having been elected, she and I sat down and we had a very transparent and honest conversation about why things were the way they were and what needed to happen to get the county’s efforts on track. I think she recognized immediately that we had to be involved.” Woolworth said the result was a “win-win-win” situation. “The county has a great deal, the Heat has its own marketing partnership with FTX.us and FTX gets its name on one of the most successful and iconic arenas in the world and a partnership with us,” Woolworth said, “who has got over 25 million social media followers and are a real platform to make sure the world knows who FTX is in short order. I think we created that win-win-win situation by working together as partners.” A 19-year agreement is a long deal, but Woolworth said the Heat plans to use the arena for the entirety of that time and Bankman-Fried said he feels confident in FTX’s “long-term positioning” after launching just two years ago. The Dallas Mavericks have been accepting Bitcoin as a method of payment for game tickets and merchandise for almost two years, but Woolworth said there are no current plans for the Heat to begin accepting cryptocurrency as a form of payment at the arena. Miami-Dade’s agreement brings the NBA its first arena sponsor from the cryptocurrency industry. Bankman-Fried said Miami’s recent enthusiasm for the cryptocurrency movement, specifically City of Miami Mayor Francis Suarez suggesting his city should start offering bitcoin as a welcomed currency, factored into his decision target the Heat’s arena as one he wanted his company’s name to be tied to. “It mattered. I think a piece of that is Mayor Suarez,” Bankman-Fried said. “I think a piece of that is the county leadership as well between the mayor and the commissioners, and a piece of that is the team and the league. I think all of those pointed really strongly in a really exciting direction there. In the end, we want to have partners who are excited to work with us and are excited about the potential of our business.”",4,0.85,"The article highlights a significant and positive business deal involving naming rights and a partnership, indicating strong optimism and future growth potential.",2,0.7,"The partnership between FTX and the Miami Heat introduces mainstream exposure for cryptocurrency, but the lack of immediate plans to accept crypto as payment and the long-term nature of the deal suggest a moderate risk level."
2021-04-07 13:55:01+00:00,Bitcoin & Blockchain Gain Prominence: 4 Top Stocks to Buy,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-blockchain-gain-prominence-4-135501082.html,Zacks,"Bitcoin’s scintillating rally in 2021 shows its rapid evolution from being a mere buzzword to a powerful digital currency. The cryptocurrency is up more than 99% year to date and has surpassed $1 trillion in market capitalization.Bitcoin’s rally is also helping the underlying blockchain technology gain prominence. Blockchain is actually an electronic distributed ledger. It is relatively faster in closing a transaction as the need for manual processing and authentication by intermediaries is eliminated as it deploys a distributed consensus.Moreover, as blockchain uses distributed consensus, it is difficult to alter data on the system without alerting the entire network. This makes the system enormously secure.Both bitcoin and blockchain present significant investment opportunities. Let’s dig deep.
Bitcoin has shown promises of becoming a widely-accepted digital currency, thanks to recent endorsements by institutional investors.Tesla’s TSLA investment of $1 billion in bitcoin and its plan to accept the digital currency as a payment instrument for its cars have been a game changer for the cryptocurrency.Moreover, Twitter’s CEO Jack Dorsey along with rapper Jay Z recently launched a bitcoin development fund by investing 500 bitcoins.SquareSQ, which is also headed by Dorsey, recently bought $50 million worth of bitcoin. Further, Square peers Paypal and Mastercard have been taking initiatives to embrace the digital currency.Further, the world’s largest institutional holder of the digital currency - Grayscale Bitcoin Trust - plans to convert the trust into an exchange-traded fund (ETF). Additionally, Coinbase Global, the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, is set to trade publicly through direct listing on Apr 14. Both these developments are expected to boost bitcoin’s attractiveness among investors.Of late, banking giants J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs have shown interest in dealing with bitcoin. Markedly, bitcoin faces significant regulatory pressure around the world. Central banks have been reluctant to approve bitcoin’s legitimacy, primarily due to its volatility, which has hindered crypto’s potential to gain mass adoption. In fact, the Securities and Exchange Commission has so far declined to approve a bitcoin ETF due to volatility and lack of price transparency.Banks, among financial institutions, generally face significant regulatory scrutiny because of their role in the economy. This has been a major reason behind their reluctancy in accepting bitcoin. In fact, during 2017 rally, J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon famously called bitcoin a ‘fraud,’ and “worse than tulip bulbs,” referring to the Dutch tulip bubble burst in the 1600s. Hence, likely change in stance by banking majors bodes well for bitcoin’s future in the long haul.In fact, the pandemic has raised the need for an alternative currency. Bitcoin has been benefiting from solid adoption by millennials and Gen X, who are looking to hedge against coronavirus-induced weakness in traditional currencies, including U.S. dollar as well as inflation.
Blockchain is enabling enterprises and government agencies to tackle prominent issues, including data tracing, security, visibility and management, and supply chain supervision.The technology is being utilized to enhance smart payment systems, secure financial transactions, advance shipping and transportation, modernize government agencies and institutions, and even detect critical illnesses.Markedly, per Fortune Business Insights report, the worldwide global market for blockchain is forecast to witness a CAGR of 56.1% between 2020 and 2027 and reach $69.04 billion. Moreover, according to PwC, blockchain has the “potential to add $1.76 trillion to the global economy by 2030.”

2021-04-07 14:14:24+00:00,New parasitic wasp species discovered in Norway,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/parasitic-wasp-species-discovered-norway-141424506.html,The Independent,"Cuckoo wasps are also known as emerald wasps due to their iridescent carapaces (Arnstein Staverløkk) A new species of parasitic wasp, which lays its eggs in other bee and wasp nests where their larvae hatch and eat their hosts’ developing offspring, has been discovered in Norway. The species belongs to a group of insects known as cuckoo wasps , due to their underhand child-rearing methods similar to the birds. They have brightly coloured iridescent carapaces that shine like jewels, and they are also known as emerald wasps, but due to their physical similarities it has been very difficult for etymologists to distinguish some species. New DNA coding techniques have allowed scientists to definitively tell the insects apart for the first time, helping to lead to the discovery of the species. Frode Ødegaard, an insect researcher at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), said: “Normally we distinguish insects from each other by their appearance, but cuckoo wasps are so similar to each other that it makes it difficult.” Read more: Extinction Rebellion announces ‘wave’ of action against banks over fossil fuel investments Pollution from Europe’s coal plants responsible for ‘up to 34,000 deaths each year’ Climate activists divided over whether Cop26 should still go ahead if online only Bitcoin mining is disastrous for the environment – it is time for governments to intervene Welcome to Dunbar, Scotland’s first zero-waste town The research team at the university said the new species is very rare, and that only a single specimen has been found on the Lista peninsula in Agder county in southern Norway. For more than 200 years, researchers have struggled to sort cuckoo wasps into the right “species boxes” and to determine which characteristics are variations within a species and which are species-specific differences. But over the last decade DNA barcoding has brought about a major breakthrough by making it possible to distinguish different species of cuckoo wasps from each other by looking at the differences in their genetic material. Story continues ""But it’s not always that easy, either,” said Dr Ødegaard. “In this case, we had two cuckoo wasps with microscopic differences in appearance and very small differences in DNA. “The next step was to look at the language of each of the wasps to find out if they belonged to different species.” The wasps communicate with each other through pheromones – which the researchers said was like a chemical language. Very closely related species often have completely different pheromone languages to prevent them from interbreeding. But the cuckoo wasp has above-average linguistic abilities, which they put to devastating use in order to succeed in getting host species to rear their young. The parasitic species behaves like cuckoos – laying their eggs in the nests of bees and other wasps. The larvae grow quickly and hatch before the host’s eggs. Then they eat the eggs, the larvae and the food supply that the host has arranged in the nest. “When you live as a parasite, it’s important not to be discovered, and therefore the cuckoo wasp has also learned the language of its host,” said Dr Ødegaard. By conducting what the researchers described as “an ever-so-small language study”, the scientists discovered that the two almost identical cuckoo wasps did indeed belong to different species. They use different hosts – and that means that they also speak completely different languages. “The evolutionary development associated with sponging off another species happens very fast. That’s why you can have two species that are really similar genetically but still belong to different species,” said Dr Ødegaard. When a new species is described it has to be given a name, and Dr Ødegaard had the good fortune to receive the honour of naming the newcomer. “A naming competition was announced among researchers in Europe who work with cuckoo wasps, and then the proposals that came in were voted on. It turned out my proposal actually got the most votes!” said Dr Ødegaard. “As mentioned, the new wasp is very similar to another species called Chrysis brevitarsis, so the new species was named Chrysis parabrevitarsis, which means ‘the one standing next to brevitarsis’.” Dr Ødegaard was also responsible for giving the species its slightly simpler Norwegian name of sporegullveps. He makes no secret of the fact that he found it great to be able to name a new species. “In a way, you place yourself in the perspective of eternity, because that species will always have that name,” he said. “There’s something very fundamental about it.” The only known specimen of this cuckoo wasp has been captured and pinned in an insect collection, the researchers said. “Even with today’s advanced methods, using live animals for studies like this isn’t possible, but collecting individual specimens fortunately has no impact on the population,” Dr Ødegaard said. “The insects have enormous reproductive potential, and the size and quality of the habitats are what determine the viability of the population, not whether any specimens are eaten by birds or collected by an insect researcher.” He said the collected insects are absolutely crucial for researchers to be able to map and describe their diversity and thus take care of viable populations for posterity.

TheVC firmseeks to act as a bridge for fundraising between traditional market investors and the crypto space. Its strategy revolves around investment in new tokens along with industry standards and emerging startups. Currently, the Pluto portfolio includes emerging companies like DexTools, AmpNet, and Vortex DeFi. They have also invested in digital currencies like BTC, ETH, and DOT.
Furthermore, Pluto will invest in Yaqub’s own project, YOP, a chain agnostic DeFi tool. The tool will extend access to decentralized finance for general retail investors.
Yaqub has made a name for himself in the crypto space in the relatively short span of five years. He began mining bitcoin and ethereum but now heads product development projects in the DeFi scene like YOP.
Pluto Digital Assets isone of many venture capital firmscurrently betting on the emerging crypto space. Therecent success of Ethereumhas piqued institutional interest in DeFi products across the board.
While DeFi has become one of the most profitable trends in the crypto space, it also resists investment from traditional investors due to its complex nature. Pluto has therefore made this one of its major focus areas.

2021-04-07 15:32:47+00:00,How Coinbase’s Wild Earnings Stack Up Against Normie Financial Firms,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coinbase-wild-earnings-stack-against-153247901.html,CoinDesk,"Based on earnings estimates announced Tuesday, nothing else in the financial services industry really compares to Coinbase right now.
Wedded to the rising fortunes of cryptocurrencies themselves, soon-to-list Coinbaseexpectsto make more money in the first quarter of this year than in all of 2020, and has seen anexponential rise in engaged customers.
Coinbase’s revenue for the first three months of 2021 is expected to be $1.8 billion with earnings of about $800 million, compared with $1.3 billion in revenue and earnings of $322 million for all of 2020. Crypto is booming right now, withbitcoinholding its own not far below $60,000.
Related:Ziglu Offers UK Users 5% Interest on Bitcoin Investments
Ahead of next week’s listing of COIN stock, the obvious question is whether the current quarter is an outlier or, as some stolid crypto believers may be thinking, the new normal.
In this respect, seasoned crypto watchers will recall that Coinbase reported bumper revenue ofclose to $1 billion in 2017, and close to half of that was booked inDecember of that yearwhen the price of bitcoin rose to then-all-time highs near $20,000.
Still, when Coinbase does list on April 14, Wall Street will have to sit up and take notice, and also begin comparing the stock to other listed brokerage and investment firms.
It’s hard to predict how long the crypto industry’s current upswing will last, but it’s fun to compare large listed trading firms with Coinbase, especially because it has been an unusual year for everyone.
Related:Mysterious Filings Suggest Impostor Is Using Grayscale's Name to Pump Obscure Coins
In fact, 2020 was ahuge yearfor the retail investing industry, thanks to the COVID-19 lockdown, the explosion of interest around WallStreetBets and also large plays like brokerage giant Charles Schwab’s acquisition of rival TD Ameritrade.
Schwab added 15.77 million new clients in the fourth quarter, which includes 14.5 million new brokerage accounts from the TD Ameritrade merger. The merged company now has about 29 million brokerage accounts and handled some $6.69 trillion in client assets at the end of 2020.
Coinbase saw its monthly active users jump from 2.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 to 6.1 million in the first quarter of 2021. The overall number of people with Coinbase accounts increased from 43 million last year to 56 million. Total assets on Coinbase’s platform increased from$90 billionto $223 billion, nearly a 150% increase quarter over quarter.
Meanwhile, Robinhood, which added crypto as an asset class to its commission-free trading platform back in 2018, saw its transaction volume double in 2020 (boosted in no small part by WSB-type trading inGameStopand AMC Theatres), and its daily average revenue tradesoutperformedpublicly traded, incumbent brokerage firms like Schwab.
Robinhood, which has over13 million customers, also offers an interesting comparison with Coinbase in that the brokerage platform has announced its intention to list later this year. An increase in the price of Robinhood shares in secondary market trading could see the app reacha $40 billion valuation, about twice the figure predicted back in December.
When Coinbase debuts on Nasdaq later this month, it’s expected to command a value of about $100 billion. Even based on a conservative value of $300 a share, Coinbase is now worth more than InterContinental Exchange (ICE) Group, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). ICEreported earningsof $2.1 billion in 2020.
The crypto space is understandably in a state of excitement.
But this could also turn out costly. There’s a good chance Coinbase stock will be driven up in price by Wall Street investors who don’t fully understand crypto cyclicality, and who are probably not considering a possible 50% pullback in bitcoin’s price down the line.

Dimon Looks At The Horizon: In his annual letter to shareholders, Dimon gave a thumbs-up to the circumstances shaping the socioeconomic environment. ""I have little doubt that with excess savings, new stimulus savings, huge deficit spending, more QE, a new potential infrastructure bill, a successful vaccine and euphoria around the end of the pandemic, the U.S. economy will likely boom,"" Dimon said. ""This boom could easily run into 2023 because all the spending could extend well into 2023."" But Dimon also warned that any boom cannot be sustained without significant discipline from the federal government. ""The permanent effect of this boom will be fully known only when we see the quality, effectiveness and sustainability of the infrastructure and other government investments,"" he said. ""I hope there is extraordinary discipline on how all of this money is spent. Spent wisely, it will create more economic opportunity for everyone."" See Also: JPMorgan On The Lookout For Cryptocurrency Clearinghouse: Forbes Dimon On The Evolution Of Financial Services: Dimon warned ""banks are playing an increasingly smaller role in the financial system,"" which he blamed on a combination of factors including onerous regulations and rising competition from nonbank lenders, fintechs and retail and technology companies that are permeating the financial services sector with banking products. The competition does not carry the same regulatory compliance requirements that banks face, Dimon said, adding that this could result in new risks that are not being addressed by regulators. As for his institution, Dimon said he is still focused on building a new headquarters in New York City that will accommodate 12,000 to 14,000 employees, and he dropped a not-subtle clue that he has a shopping list and is ready to go buying. ""We have mentioned that our highest and best use of capital is to expand our businesses, and we would prefer to make great acquisitions instead of buying back stock,"" he said. ""Acquisitions are in our future, and fintech is an area where some of that cash could be put to work — this could include payments, asset management, data, and relevant products and services."" Dimon On The Private Sector And Politics: Dimon acknowledged that the U.S. came out of 2020 battered and bruised from acute challenges ranging from the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic tumult it created, the unrest after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody and the divisive presidential election. Story continues As a result of these issues, Dimon said the public mood has turned sour and distrustful. ""Many Americans have lost faith in their government's ability to solve these and other problems — in fact, most people would describe government as ineffective, bureaucratic and often biased,"" he said ""Almost all institutions — governments, schools, media and businesses — have lost credibility in the eyes of the public. And perhaps for good reason: Many of our problems have been around for a long time and are not aging well. Politics is increasingly divisive, and government is increasingly dysfunctional, leading to a number of policies that simply don't work."" Although Dimon said ""people are right to be angry and feel let down,"" he warned against anti-government sentiment. ""Our failures fuel the populism on both the political left and right,"" he said. ""But populism is not policy, and we cannot let it drive another round of poor planning and bad leadership that will simply make our country's situation worse."" Dimon called on his fellow corporate leaders in becoming more vocal in addressing social and political issues, insisting that executives ""should not be buttonholed by the debate about whether there are ‘fiduciary' reasons to think of ‘shareholder value' narrowly and to the exclusion of those who work at the company, our clients and communities."" He also insisted the private sector could play a role in solving the problems bedeviling government leaders. ""JPMorgan Chase takes an active role in large-scale public policy issues,"" he said. ""We are fully engaged in trying to solve some of the world's biggest issues — climate change, poverty, economic development and racial inequality – and the accompanying features that follow describe the extensive efforts we are making. With well-designed policies, we think these problems can all be solved.""

2021-04-07 16:29:12+00:00,Aspesi Wants Its Slice of China,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aspesi-wants-slice-china-162912658.html,WWD,"MILAN — Aspesi wants to bring its chic understatement to China , digitally. The company has teamed with Farfetch’s digital and tech company Curiosity China to make its debut on WeChat and Weibo, while an official store is expected to bow on Tmall in September. More from WWD Photos of Vivienne Westwood’s Career From the Fairchild Fashion Archives “This is a real debut in China , where we have no retail presence,” explained Aspesi chief executive officer Simona Clemenza. “But, since some online wholesale partners had very positive results selling our collections, we wanted to directly approach the market, focusing on digital.” As the CEO highlighted, through WeChat and Weibo, Aspesi aims to boost its brand awareness, paving the way for the launch of the online store on Tmall. “We are debuting digitally, but when the market is ready, we aim to open some physical points of sale,” said Clemenza, who expects China to account for 20 percent of the brand’s business in five years. While Italy is still the company’s biggest market, Northern Europe, Germany and Switzerland are performing very well in terms of online sales, which in 2020 increased 30 percent compared to the previous year. In order to capitalize on that, Aspesi, whose digital business accounts for 10 percent of total revenues, decided to revamp its online shop, bringing its management in-house. “It has been an incredible effort for the company, but we think that it’s so important for us to directly operate our online business, which has great potential for growth,” said Clemenza, who added that the e-commerce site will feature innovative tools, including the chance to pay with Bitcoins, and will be central in the development of an omnichannel strategy to include the brand’s 15 physical shops. In March 2020, Aspesi kicked off an ambitious retail expansion plan, which included the opening of a 2,153-square-foot flagship in Tokyo’s luxury Aoyama district , the inauguration of a concession at the Rinascente department store in Milan, where the label also operates a flagship in the heart of the Golden Triangle luxury shopping district, as well as the debut of a boutique on the island of Capri and of space inside Madrid’s department store El Corte Inglés. The plan continued with the relocation last month of the Madrid flagship, which was moved to luxury shopping avenue Calle Lagasca. “We are registering very positive results there, although the moment is very complicated,” said Clemenza. “The fact that we moved to the city’s most prestigious shopping area and we are surrounded by the most important luxury brands seems to be a winning choice for the brand.” Story continues At the same time, Aspesi is expanding its retail footprint in Italy with the opening of a flagship in Verona, and in France with a franchised shop in Saint-Tropez. The wholesale channel continues to contribute to the lion’s share of Aspesi’s total business, accounting for 60 percent of its turnover. “This is going to be such a key year for our wholesale business, since beginning in June we will present our clients the first collections designed by creative director Lawrence Steele,” said Clemenza. In November, Steele, who worked as a design consultant for Aspesi for 13 years, from 2004 to 2017, was named creative director, a new role for the brand. The designer joined Aspesi from Marni, where he worked as associate creative director supporting Francesco Risso. “We are so excited to have Lawrence on board. From what I’ve started to see, I believe he is interpreting Aspesi’s understated, effortless elegance at best,” said Clemenza. “I think that it was finally time for the brand to give voice to a creative director who can set a direction and communicate it at many levels.” According to Clemenza, Steele who is American, will also help boost the international visibility of the label. Aspesi, for example, has recently signed with a high-end distributor to expand its wholesale business in North America. Aspesi, which is controlled by investment fund Armonia Sgr, closed 2019 with revenues of 46 million euros, up 10 percent over the two-year period 2017 to 2019. Figures for the 2020 fiscal year are not available yet, according to Clemenza.

Cryptocurrency data analytics platformBybt.com reportedthat, in that time period, over 295,817 traders were liquidated. The single largest liquidation was valued at $10 million, made on Bitmex-BTC.
It is not the first multi-billion-dollar mass liquidation on the market this year. The crypto market saw nearly $3 million liquidated in a 24-hour periodback in January. In this instance, Bitcoin, in particular, showed nearly $38 million and $580 million, respectively.
Leading the liquidation figures was Bitcoin (BTC), of which $529 million was sold. Ripple (XRP) was next, of which $270 million was liquidated in the last 24 hours. Over 60% of the liquidations took place on Binance, comprising a majority figure of over $10 million worth. Meanwhile, the second-most were on Huobi, accounting for nearly $4 million.
According todata, there was a significant dip in the BTC/USD pair’s value earlier this morning. From a local high of over $58,500 at 2 AM ETD, bitcoin fell to $55,851 only six hours later.
Furthermore, in the last seven hours,it was reportedthat bitcoin had remained within 5% of its all-time highs. That being said, their futures closed slightly lower – almost 2%. This decrease brought the price of April’s bitcoin futures to just under $59,000.
Meanwhile, ethereum (ETH) reached anall-time high on Tuesday. It increased by over 20% to reach a value of more than $2,100.

I know, that’s a bold statement. And especially by a journalist whose job is to report on events, not influence them. For the record: I was NOT trying to influence the legislative process here.
But I think I did. And the episode speaks to the surprising malleability of legislators when, after a year of crafting massive legislation, you catch them off guard. Allow me to explain.
Related:All About Bitcoin - April 9, 2021
West Virginia’s Legislature is considering a sweeping overhaul to the state’s criminal code – its biggest in decades – with a package delegates have been sharpening for nearly a year. Their 400-page behemoth would strengthen drug sentencing, expand homicide provisions, modernize anti-hacking statutes and establish a tiered system for misdemeanors and felonies.
Pretty normal fare for a criminal code overhaul. But I noticed something strange last week in House Bill 2017. It seemed to ban people from issuing or transacting in cryptocurrencies not sanctioned bythe 38th most populous state in the U.S.
“If any person shall, without authority of law, issue any note,cryptocurrency, or other security purporting that money or other thing of value is payable by or on behalf of such person, with intent thereby to create a circulating medium, he or she shall be guilty of a misdemeanor,” read the section 61-4-7 of the bill. (Cryptocurrency, bolded here, was new to the “unauthorized currency” provision).
Related:The Hash - April 9, 2021
Huh? Was this a crypto ban? I wasn’t sure. The following section, 61-4-8, only made me more confused:
“If any person … shall knowingly pass or receive in payment any such note,cryptocurrency, or security, he or she shall be guilty of a Class 3 misdemeanor.”
Sure looked like a crypto ban to me. But I’m no lawyer. Hell, I haven’t even ordered those LSAT study books yet. (Sorry, Mom!) So I emailed a fewrealattorneys to hear their take.
Drew Hinkes of Carlton Fields responded first. “This bill would benefit from further clarification,” he began. Not a very promising start.
HB 2017’s “very curious definition” of cryptocurrency was unlikely to spell a sweeping ban on digital assets or any crypto with supposed intrinsic value (bitcoin), Hinkes explained. Rather, it seemed tailored to “cryptocurrencies that promise payment to the holder,” or perhaps asset-backed stablecoins with redeemable reserves.
(My favorite example of an asset-backed, redeemable crypto is sardine coin. Holders can exchange their tokens for a vintage tin of salty fish. That European initial coin offering is, alas, not available to U.S. residents. More relevant are dollar-pegged stablecoins likeUSDT,USDCandDAI, which are backed by fiat currency in a brick-and-mortar bank and/or other assets and boast a combined market capitalization of $56 billion, or 77% ofWest Virginia’s annual GDP.)
Carol Van Cleef of Bradley was my next stop. She deemed the proposal “disturbing” and said it would render authorized stablecoins “as a nonfactor in payments.”
“When I see something like this – my first question is where did it come from, who is behind and why,” she said.
I agreed. So I found the emails of the bill’s 11 co-sponsors and contacted themen masse.
I did not realize it then, but Wednesday was set to be a banner day for HB 2017. After nearly a year of drafting and committee work, it was headed for final vote on third reading. The cryptocurrency rider had been in there from the start and it was just hours away from passing.
I woke up to a cordial email from Delegate Bryan Ward. “Good morning, sir,” wrote the first-term member. “This bill was voluminous and technical amendments are forthcoming in an effort to perfect the language.”
“An amendment, specifically addressing your concern relating to cryptocurrency will be offered by Delegate Daniel Linville. I’m fortunate to have colleagues here in the house of delegates with broad ranging expertises. Your contribution to the process of crafting the best bill is appreciated.”
What? My contribution to the crafting of a better bill? I am not a constituent of West Virginia nor am I a registered lobbyist. I know how to report, not how to influence. I was not sure what was going on.
Linville, who chairs the Technology and Infrastructure Committee, emailed me theamendmenthe would propose on the floor of the house of delegates later that day. It would strike all mentions of cryptocurrency from section 61-4-7.
“This should be taken up within the next few hours,” he said.
So I tuned into the livestream on YouTube. Indeed, a few hours later, Linville asked his fellow delegates to adopt his amendment. He said he had met with the bill’s co-sponsor that morning and decided to excise cryptocurrency from the law. Better to remove a few words than pass a bill suggesting crypto was counterfeit money, he said. Would his fellow delegates sign on?
“Aye,” agreed the chamber by voice vote, adopting the amendment. Nobody stood in his way.
HB 2017 then passed the House by a vote of 76 to 22.
Shortly after the bill’s passage I began reviewing my notes. It sure seemed that I had acted like a last-minute lobbyist for the cryptocurrency industry – though I hadn’t meant to do it. I had found a bill confusing, interviewed lawyers who also found the bill confusing, and then dug up the email addresses of 11 politicians who, when prompted, found their bill confusing, too.
“This bill was voluminous and technical amendments are forthcoming in an effort to perfect the language,” Ward had said to me.“Your contribution to the process of crafting the best bill is appreciated.”
(I have emailed Linville and Ward to ask if the amendment was being planned even before I reached out, but have not heard back.)
All this happened in the final moments before the bill’s passage in the house. On the third reading.
But it’s a good thing for the crypto industry I am not a lobbyist because, despite torpedoing the stablecoin provision without even trying, I still wouldn’t be a very effective one. Remember, there weretwosections of this bill in question, the first (61-4-7) to make unauthorized stablecoin issuance illegal and a second (61-4-8) to bar the transfer of such cryptos between parties.
Also remember: An amendment “specifically addressing my concern” had been offered and approved. I had only mentioned 61-4-7 in my email. Likewise, the amendment only did away with the ban in cryptocurrency issuance. Which means that if the bill is enacted into law, it would still … ban crypto transfers?
I’m really not sure. And neither was Hinkes, the lawyer who thought the bill’spreviousrendition warranted a rewrite.
“Without ‘cryptocurrency’ in [section 7], [section 8] makes less sense,” he told me, pointing out the statute’s “any such” clause references a cryptocurrency that’s no longer there. Perhaps the courts could enforce the ghost clause through complicated judicial jiu-jitsu, but probably not.
“Again, this bill as amended would benefit from further clarity,” he said.
The bill is now up for consideration in the West Virginia Senate.

The Lightning Network  an additional layer added to bitcoins network to facilitate transactions  now has more than 10,000 nodes after major cryptocurrency exchanges and payment apps adopted the technology. Bitcoin was originally conceived as a new form of currency, having been described as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system in the 2008 white paper written by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto. However limitations to bitcoins underlying blockchain have led to significant inefficiencies within the network for processing transactions. The bitcoin scalability problem, as it is known, means that the more the bitcoin network grows, the more cumbersome it becomes. Each new user makes it increasingly time consuming and costly to send and receive payments, to the point that buying something small like a coffee can come with a fee that is higher than the cost of the drink itself. Read more: Bitcoin mining in China will exceed energy needs of 181 countries Bitcoin price close to record high amid permanent hike predictions How bad is bitcoin for the environment really? Various solutions have been proposed, including forking bitcoins blockchain to create a brand new cryptocurrency in the form of bitcoin cash . None of bitcoins rivals match its mainstream recognition, however, which is why some people within the bitcoin industry have championed the use of the Lightning Network to make the cryptocurrency a viable form of payment. It works by routing payments through a separate peer-to-peer system that is built on top of bitcoins blockchain, therefore reducing the burden on the main network. It decreases transaction times from minutes or hours, to just a fraction of a second, while simultaneously eliminating any fees. One of the earliest adopters of the Lightning Network was the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, which used it to enable fast deposits and withdrawals from its platform. Over the last year, crypto exchanges Kraken, CoinCorner and OKCoin have all integrated the Lightning Network into their systems. Story continues We are seeing genuine adoption of this amazing technology, Paolo Ardoino, chief technology officer at Bitfinex, told The Independent . If you look back at 2017 the capacity of the network was nowhere near what it is now. Layering solutions are now boosting levels of scalability on both bitcoin and ethereum. Bitfinex processed 12,000 transactions on the Lightning Network in February alone. Data from Bitcoin Visuals shows that the number of Lightning Network nodes rose from 4,000 to 5,000 between April 2019 and April 2020, before shooting up to above 10,000 this month. But scalability is only one obstacle preventing bitcoin from being used as a day-to-day currency  another is scarcity. Nakamoto designed bitcoin so that only 21 million will ever exist, which avoids inflationary issues facing traditional fiat currencies. This in-built scarcity has attracted major investors in recent months, who refer to it as digital gold. Massive investments from companies like Tesla and MicroStrategy have contributed to bitcoins remarkable rally over the last year, which has seen it rise in price from around $6,000 to $60,000. The investments have effectively removed these bitcoin from circulation and created a liquidity crisis. Figures from market intelligence firm Glassnode suggest there is only around 4.2 million bitcoins in constant circulation that are available for everyday use. Around 78 per cent of the circulating bitcoin supply is considered illiquid. Currently we are at a stage in which the illiquid supply is growing more than the total circulating supply, a research note from December 2020 warned. As bitcoin continues to become more and more a store of value and investors increasingly... make use of it as a safe haven asset to store wealth, the actual liquid bitcoin supply can be expected to be considerably lower.",4,0.85,"The article highlights significant growth and adoption of the Bitcoin Lightning Network, suggesting a positive outlook for Bitcoin's utility as a day-to-day currency.",3,0.75,"The growth of the Lightning Network enhances Bitcoin's utility for daily transactions, but scarcity and liquidity issues pose significant risks to its widespread adoption as a day-to-day currency."
2021-04-07 17:31:27+00:00,$1B Fei Stablecoin’s Rocky Start Is a Wake-Up Call for DeFi Investors,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1b-fei-stablecoin-rocky-start-173127458.html,CoinDesk,"The $1 billion Fei Protocolstablecoinproject has gotten off to a very rocky start.
The most important data point is this: Fei was built to maintain a 1:1 peg with the U.S. dollar but it has not quite hit the mark over this first week of its existence.
Backed by major VCs, Fei aimed to create a stablecoin protocol that would outright buy assets with its token, rather than holding them as collateral for loans. It appears the team underestimated the demand it would see to participate in the launch. It also seems clear that many of those who jumped into the project didn’t understand Fei’s “direct incentive” method for stabilizing the price.

FEI’s struggles show that the launch of a new decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol is not a sure path to easy money, despite what many individual investors may have come to assume. The episode could be the tipping point where retail investors realize they have to be more judicious about hopping in, perhaps erring on the side of longer-term aims rather than the quick buck.
For the first few days FEI danced around a nickel to a dime off the target. Since yesterday it has tanked hard, now almost a quarter off its goal of $1,according to CoinGecko.
Fei’s main technique for maintaining its peg to the dollar not only hasn’t worked, each time it kicks in it briefly makes matters worse.
Right now the outstanding question is whether Fei as we know it will persist. It’s a stablecoin that’s much too volatile. Stablecoins have proved to be very valuable, in particular to crypto traders. They allow traders to exit quickly from short-term trades and lock in gains with an asset whose price won’t move. The most successful stablecoins thus far have relied on the U.S. dollar, and obviously crypto’s true believers want to escape fiat.

Fei’s main technique for maintaining its peg to the dollar not only hasn’t worked, each time it kicks in it briefly makes matters worse.
The situation underscores just how difficult it is to make a purely algorithmic stablecoin, something ofa persistent albatrossfor cryptocurrency entrepreneurs especially excited about the idea of programmable money.
“It’s hard to make an algorithmic stablecoin stick to the peg, and mechanisms are nascent and experimental,” said Jake Brukhman, founder and CEO of investmentfirm CoinFund. “I don’t have much skin in the game on $FEI, but I am supportive of figuring it out for the benefit of science and the blockchain space.”
The Fei team did not reply to multiple requests for comment from CoinDesk by press time.
The Fei Protocol innovates on the model of a decentralized stablecoin by creating a system where users directly purchase the stablecoin from a protocol that is capable of owning the assets used to purchase it.
Here’s a simplified model of how Fei works to help illustrate. Imagine there’s a smart contract that simply says: input $100 worth ofether(ETH, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization) and the contract will issue 100 FEI to whatever wallet sent in the ETH.
There’s no upper bound on the amount of FEI that can be issued other than the fact the smart contract that mints it does so only when it gets purchased. FEI is made on demand, not in anticipation of it, in other words.This is mostly right, but we’ll circle back to this.
For now that’s the basic idea. The main protocol Fei competes with is MakerDAO. MakerDAO createsDAIas a loan. Users put up collateral and can borrow up to two-thirds of its value in DAI. Eventually they have to pay the loan back with interest to get their collateral back, though, so there is a sense that the assets still belong to the borrowers.
The big innovation is that funds put into Feibelongto Fei. Fei is created not with a debt, but atrade.
Fei has a few ways that it can enforce its peg to the dollar.
First, Fei created a pool on Uniswap, the decentralized trading protocol, that it uses to support the peg. The smart contract that controls FEI is able to create incentives for buying from and selling to that pool.
So far the price has only been below the peg, so we only need to deal with that side of the equation. FEI theoretically incentivizes users to hold by burning some FEI any time they sell to the Uniswap pool and giving them a little any time they buy from it.
In theory, this should increase buy pressure and discourage sell pressure. But it hasn’t worked.
Cornell Professor Emin Gün Sirer, also the founder of theAvalanche cryptocurrencyproject, wrote anextended threadabout Fei on Twitter Wednesday. Inone tweet, on just this point, he observed, “The penalty mechanism in FEI not only makes the supply disappear, it also makes demand disappear. It punishes both sides, and therebynarrows the feasibility envelope for the coin.”
This is also a completely new mechanic and, as we know, few people read documentation carefully (this is true well beyond DeFi). Never before has Uniswap shown a stated price but then delivered less than it stated on a trade. This happens because some FEI gets burned on a sale when FEI is underpriced. Users haven’t wrapped their heads around it, but it’s causing something of a panic to exit.
That’s evident every time Fei exercises its other mechanic, the reweight.
The reweight is a bit complicated, but here’s a description that’s as simple as possible:
Uniswap is an automated market maker, also known as a decentralized exchange (DEX). It owns no assets itself but it gives people a way to deposit pairs of assets into it and earn a little bit on trades users make with the protocol. So in an ETH/DAI pool, a user could put in 100 DAI and $100 worth of ETH and as people trade ETH for DAI and DAI for ETH the depositor would earn a tiny bit on each trade
The Fei protocol itself is the biggest supplier to the ETH/FEI pool on Uniswap. When FEI is trading below its target of $1, the protocol reweights the whole pool.
Step one: It withdraws all the ETH and FEI that it controls on the DEX.
Step two: There will still be some funds placed by others in the ETH/FEI pool, so Fei deposits the right amount, such that the funds that remain in the pool equal 1 FEI for $1 worth of ETH.
Step three: It deposits as much of its remaining ETH and FEI sufficient to maintain that ratio back into the Uniswap pool.
Step four: Some FEI will be left over after the reweight, because the market needs to reduce supply. That’s why the price is below the peg. That leftover FEI gets burnt.
Lots of people want to get out of FEI right now, though, so as soon as a reweight happens, users rush to exit because that’s the moment that they get the best price for FEI that they are going to get. This rush to trade leads to another plunge in value and once again FEI falls off its peg.
That’s why the reweight makes things worse for a bit each time, because a reweight, ironically, createsthe best moment to sell.
There’sa debatein the Fei community right now about whether FEI will find its footing when more decentralized finance apps create uses for FEI or if none of them will until FEI finds its footing.
Users can hold FEI and its governance token, TRIBE, and stake them in the FEI/TRIBE Uniswap pool to earn more distributions of TRIBE. Right now, that’s the only real reason to hold FEI, though, until other DeFi apps open up to it.
One topic that hasn’t received a ton of attention is how collateralized FEI is.
In the debate noted above, one Fei supporter on the forum argued that FEI is overcollateralized. But looked at another way, it’s undercollateralized.
The ETH that Fei owns now came from a launch event whereby early supporters put in ETH and got FEI at a discount (the formula was complicated). Fei acquired more than $1 billion worth of ETH this way.
So all those wallets got FEI and then the protocol kicked off the Uniswap pool. The pool would launch at 1 FEI equalling $1 of ETH. Theoretically, it should hold that peg. But where did the FEI in the Uniswap pool come from? According to the project’s white paper:
“The FEI for this deposit comes from minting, and therefore this PCV [Protocol Controlled Value] Deposit must be appointed as a Minter by Fei Core. The amount of FEI minted is equivalent to the amount of ETH times the spot price of FEI/ETH in the pool.”
In other words, Fei just minted more FEI to match the value of ETH that went into the pool.
So (in simplified terms), a billion FEI were minted to buyers with the $1 billion worth of ETH that got spent in the launch event. Then, another billion FEI were minted to pair with that same ETH to go in the Uniswap pool.
So this is where we’re circling back. One could argue that this pile of FEI in Uniswap was made in anticipation of demand and it isn’treallycirculating. It’s more efficient, in terms of on-chain computation (“gas”) fees, for a user to buy it on Uniswap this way than to go straight to Fei. So it could be argued it’s fair not to think of the Uniswap FEI asrealFEI until someone buys it.
That’s why the Fei analytics page shows a protocol controlled value (PCV) of $1.3 billion. This is how much assets Fei’s smart contracts own. But the market cap of FEI is $2.2 billion.
Looked at one way: FEI in a Uniswap pool isn’t exactly circulating supply. Looked at another way: well, we don’t look at any other assets that exist inside Uniswap asnotpart of circulating supply.
This realization may factor into some of the anxiety around Fei now. With $1 billion worth of ETH at hand, it could have bought some of the newly minted FEI off the market to create the Uniswap pool. It would have been a smaller pool, but this is also a new token.
Nascent Capital’s Dan Elitzer, a backer of Fei, does not think this is the true issue, however. He told CoinDesk over Twitter DM, “I find it hard to believe that people are selling because they think it’s undercollateralized; they’re selling because a lot of them aped into a system they didn’t understand, thinking there was a pure arb opportunity. There just isn’t enough natural demand for FEI at this point given the massive initial supply, hence the sell pressure.”
The Fei team is considering a number of options to hit the peg now. Joey Santoro, the founder,kicked off the discussion, with options such as having reweights occur at regular intervals and reigning in the direct incentives so users are less reluctant to make moves.
Conversation around the options Santoro presented centered on the need for use cases for FEI. Another holder, going by fei.saver, came in to say that the peg is more important than usage, urging modifications that wouldincrease the paceof reweights.
The discussion has been active ever since. Santoro, the founder, for his part, has voicedsupport in the forumsfor increasing the cadence of reweights and easing up on the incentives built into the Uniswap pool.
In the FEI Discord forum on Tuesday,he wrote: “@Everyone the PCV is safe and the protocol is still overcollateralized, we will move forward with a solution to help allow FEI to exchange for the fair market price.”
As Brukhman put it, “Experimenters will experiment.”

Today, cities direct their police forces to prevent and prosecute theft. But crime is a tough problem, and policing is costly. What cities should do instead isauction off the right to mug people and burglarize homes. Sure, burglaries would become more professional to take advantage of any vulnerable property. But on the bright side, cities can use theft auction money to pay city workers’ salaries, offset shortfalls in tax revenue and fund new policing initiatives (including prosecution of unauthorized theft).

Horrendous idea? Yes, it is. And it’s now starting to happen in Ethereum, thanks to new projects, such asFlashbots, andpractices by miners, that systematize exploitation of users.
A paradoxical limitation of most blockchain protocols, including Ethereum and Eth 2.0, is that while their key feature is decentralization, they areephemerally centralized.
When miners (or validators) form a block, they have the power to decide unilaterally what transactions to include and how to order them. The miner can’t include bogus transactions or directly steal money from users, so this limited power may seem insignificant. But in a smart contract system,transaction order impacts the flow of money, giving miners more sway.
Consider, for example, an automated market maker (AMM) that allows assets to be traded without counterparties within a decentralized finance (DeFi) system. Buying TokenXfrom the AMM causes the price of TokenXto rise (with respect to a paired asset). A miner can exploit this when Alice is about to buy some TokenXin a transactionT. If the miner gets to includeTin a block it mines, it can do the following.
Related:All About Bitcoin - April 9, 2021
The miner creates two of its own transactions,TpreandTpostandsandwichesTbetween them.In other words, it includes the three transactions in the orderTpreT, Tpost. The miner’s transactionTprebuyssome TokenX, while its transactionTpostsells the TokenXit’s bought. Because Alice’s transactionTcauses the price of TokenXto rise, the miner makes money: It’s selling TokenXfor more than it paid for it. But where does the miner’s profit come from? Because the miner’s buy transaction, i.e., transactionTprealso causes the price of TokenXto rise,Alice pays more than she would have if she weren’t attacked by the miner. In other words, the miner is taking money from Alice.

A 2019-2020 study with the (condensed) title “Flashboys 2.0” explored this phenomenon (one of us was a co-author.) The paper coined the termMiner Extractable Value(MEV) for arbitrage opportunities available to miners as well as to bots, which can also perform front-running by paying high gas prices. The study showed a sophisticated community of bots was already profiting from MEV in Ethereum. It also explained that the existence of MEV can destabilize consensus in a proof-of-work blockchain, threatening the integrity of the blockchain itself.
MEV exists in all kinds of places, mostly around decentralized exchanges, but also in unexpected places, likeCryptoKitty birthing. In fact, there are bots lurking around the Ethereum mempool waiting to discover new MEV opportunities by copying users’ transactions. Dan Robinson, of Paradigm,suggested the term “Dark Forest”to describe this behavior, which he encountered when trying to recover funds from a broken contract.
MEV has been a serious problem for some time, but things are now getting worse.
Miners are realizing that they control transaction ordering and can profit from this power. (Anything that bots can do, miners can do better.)Some minersare embracing an idea calledfront-running-as-a-service(FaaS) (aka MEV Auctions (MEVA) or MEV optimization), as realized by Flashbots.
FaaS is analogous to the theft auctions we (facetiously) suggested at the beginning of this post. Instead of miners developing front-running expertise themselves, in a FaaS system, minersauction off the right to front-run users. Specialist arbitrageurs can bid off-chain in real time to place their front-running transactions in mined blocks. The winner of a FaaS auction pays the hammer price to the miner in exchange for having its transactions placed as desired.
Proponents make several arguments in favor of FaaS:
• MEV extraction is unavoidable, so let’s make the best of it: A common defense of FaaS is that MEV is inherent in blockchain protocols. FaaS is therefore helpful because it streamlines MEV extraction, eliminating “negative externalities” such as mempool and on-chain congestion caused by bots competing for juicy arbitrage opportunities.
• Miners are at risk of impoverishment:The Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559 (EIP-1559), a proposed change to the Ethereum fee structure, isslated to go live this July. EIP-1559 alters fees in a way that some miners fear will diminish their revenue from transaction fees.Some have suggestedthat MEV can make up for this lost revenue.
• FaaS systems can be used torescue CryptoKittiesand other non-fungible tokens. FaaS allows a user whose private key has been compromised to transfer an NFT in a privately mined transaction without tipping off and getting front-run by an attacker to whom the key has leaked.
FaaS (and MEV in general) has no underlying principles or notion of fairness and social benefit. Taking advantage of extractable value is, in general, not a service for society, but often the contrary.
As Ed Felten, of Princeton and Offchain Labs, has astutelypointed out, FaaS is essentially a cost imposed on users willy-nilly by miners without any underlying technical or ethical principles, without a principled calibration of cost size and without any form of community agreement. It’s as though City Hall decided unilaterally to implement theft auctions to make up for a shortfall in municipal tax revenue and without much thought about which homes will be burglarized.
Looking at the arguments for FaaS: CryptoKitty rescue is, well, a noble activity, but not worth cheating the users. As for miner impoverishment, we don’t have strong opinions on how much miners should be compensated, but FaaS, as we’ve said, isn’t based on forethought about this question.
See also:Bad Sandwich: DeFi Trader ‘Poisons’ Front-Running Miners for $250K Profit
In addition to ethical concerns about FaaS, we are concerned it will tarnish the reputation of the smart contract ecosystem and ultimately attract unwanted attention from regulators, which havepenalized companies such as Robinhoodfor systematizing similar practices in traditional financial markets.
Almost everyone agrees that the current state of MEV on Ethereum is bad, so why not instead try to avoid MEV altogether? Would you rather improve security to prevent burglaries, or regularize crime and redistribute its profits? We claim that MEVis avoidableeven though some FaaS proponents like Flashbots seem to have alreadygiven up.
Researchers are already making strides in the direction of reducing or removing MEV by constructing protocols (permissionedandpermissionless) that fundamentallyorder transactions fairly to begin with.Indeed, ideas to prevent some forms of front-running – such askeeping transactions encrypted while they’re ordered– have been aroundfor decades.
Implementing these ideas is certainly not trivial, and requires substantial research, but so, too, do many other worthwhile endeavors in the blockchain community, like layer 2 systems and migration to less energy-intensive forms of mining. It is possible that MEV is in some degree inescapable, as financial systems are complex and invariably involve trade-offs. Our point is that research into the root cause and foundational solutions for MEV should be community priorities.
While FaaS may seem an attractive way to address the MEV problem, it makes sense only as part of a false narrative that there’s no other way. But therearealternative approaches to ordering transactions that provide stronger fairness assurances for users. Those approaches deserve to be tried before FaaS becomes the norm.
Decentralized systems offer an unprecedented opportunity to rebuild the financial system on a more inclusive, more democratic, and fairer basis – to help level the tilted playing field created by Wall Street. Let’s not blow it just to pick a few users’ pockets.

Recently, however, the tokens’ prices and trading volumes have declined, raising questions on whether NFT frenzy can be sustained, according to the website tracking this corner of the cryptocurrency world.
Is an NFT market crash in the offing?

“It almost seems that some have been eagerly awaiting a market correction to finally prove that NFTs have just been in a bubble,” according to an April 6blog postonNonfungible.com.
• “The average price of NFTs spiked quite astoundingly in February, peaking at around $4,000 in mid-February. Since then, record sales continue to follow, averaging around $1,500.”
• The volume of NFT sales has also declined from a peak of 80,000 in early March to around 40,000 as of March 29. Volume tends to lag price, which could be explained by a growing interest of new buyers following record sales.
• The average price of the 3 most expensive NFT type on the market peaked around $95,951 last month before declining by about 53% in just a few weeks.
• However, NFT average values tend to fluctuate over time, according to data from Nonfungible.com going back to May 2020.
The slowdown could calm what some experts have described as an NFT frenzy and bring inflated values to more reasonable levels. After all, market stability is important for professional investors who viewlong-term potential for NFTs.
It’s not enough of a pullback to call it an NFT market crash, though, Nonfungible.com said in the post. For example, the current average price of an NFT is about 10 times what it was six months ago.
“The trend seems more to show a stabilization on a high plateau following a speculative peak,” according to the website. In other words, if there’s an NFT bubble, it hasn’t popped.

That’s a question on traders’ minds after the cryptocurrency’s price jumped fivefold since October.
According to Bloomberg bitcoin (BTC) analysts, the price could climb as high as $400,000 this year, from about $56,000 now. The uber-bullish prediction is based on bitcoin’s performance during the 2017 and 2013 bull runs.
“Our graphic depicts bitcoin on similar ground as the roughly 55x gain in 2013 and 15x in 2017,”Bloomberg Crypto notedin a monthly report published this week. “To reach price extremes akin to those years in 2021, the crypto would approach $400,000, based on the regression since the 2011 high.”

While past performance is no guarantee of future results, history might rhyme. The latest bull run comes in the wake of last May’s reward halving on the Bitcoin blockchain – an automatic, every-four-years, 50% reduction in the pace of new issuance of units of the cryptocurrency.
Bitcoin chalked up staggering gains in the 12 to 18 months following the previous reward halvings in November 2012 and July 2016.
“The year after a supply cut (halving) is what 2021 has in common with 2017 and 2013, along with subdued volatility,” the Bloomberg bitcoin analysts wrote, adding that the December 2017 peak represented a 50-fold rise from the average price observed in October 2015, when the 180-day volatility reached lifetime lows.
The long-term volatility gauge almost revisited the record low in September 2020, analysts noted. Bitcoin averaged roughly $11,000 that month.

Some observers feara faster rise in bond yields could dilute the appeal of inflation hedges such as gold and bitcoin, pushing their prices lower.
However, Bloomberg analysts foresee bitcoin remaining relatively resilient in a rising yield environment.
“Rising real yields are a headwind for gold prices, but less so for bitcoin, still in its price-discovery stage,” analysts noted. “Gold is fighting a battle with bitcoin, which can earn 6%-8% in crypto savings accounts and is well on its way to becoming a global reserve asset in a digital world.”
The cryptocurrency fell by 20% in the last week of February after the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield rose to then-12-month highs above 1.5%. The yield has continued to rise since then and recently reached a 14-month high of 1.77%. The bitcoin market, meanwhile, has held firm.
According to the report, thesteep discount witnessed recently in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust(GBTC), a popular investment vehicle, is the result of increased expectations that the U.S. will eventually approve a bitcoin exchange-traded fund. GBTC is still holding its 50-day average support, which has enticed buyers in the past. (Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)

With several cryptocurrency founders featuring on the list which saw an additional 493 new billionaires created in the last year. 2020 brought forward a turbulent year that saw the Covid-19 pandemic bring the world to a standstill. However, that hasn’t stopped the rich from getting richer. This year’s Forbes list of b illionaires saw their joint net worth grow by $5 trillion. The list features a handful of cryptocurrency billionaires who have made their money from the industry. While none of them feature in the top 100, the growth of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology has certainly assisted with their net worth exploding over the past year. The Cryptocurrency Billionaires List The Forbes list breaks down billionaires based on their industries and the source of their net worth. Topping the list related to the industry sees Elon Musk, the once proclaimed “CEO of DOGE,” taking second place with a net worth of $151 billion. He falls $26 billion behind Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Number 274: Sam Bankman-Fried Founder and CEO of quantitative crypto trading firm Alameda Research and newcomer to the Forbes billionaire list. Sam becomes the highest-ranked cryptocurrency billionaire. The FTX cryptocurrency exchange CEO surges into the 274th spot with a net worth of $8.7 billion. The 29-year-old has been making waves over the past year to contribute to the industry with his derivatives exchange FTX. FTX has grown in popularity at such an alarming rate that it also holds one of the largest acquisitions in 2021. FTX purchased cryptocurrency price tracking app Blockfolio for $150 million in August 2020. The news of being on the Forbes top billionaires’ list for 2021 has been topped off by the latest partnership between FTX and the NBA Basketball team, the Miami Heat. The exchange is now the naming rights partner of the team’s stadium, called the FTX arena. It's official. https://t.co/Ti0K8DPwae — SBF (@SBF_Alameda) April 7, 2021 Number 404: Brian Armstrong This year seems to be the year for exchange founders. The CEO of Coinbase, the most popular cryptocurrency exchange in North America, climbs the list to 404. Armstrong saw his net worth climb to $6.5 billion in the latest rankings, up from $1 billion in 2020. Story continues Coinbase has recently announced it will go public following strong performances in Q1 of 2021. The company reported 56 million users, generating $1.8 billion in revenue for Q1 alone. Number 891: Chris Larsen Ripple Labs co-founder Chris Larsen features on the Forbes list once again. Larsen first appeared on the billionaire list in 2019 following the soaring price of XRP. Larsen has dropped down the list from last year, despite being worth $800 million more than the previous year. With a current net worth of $3.4 billion, Larsen takes the third spot in cryptocurrency-related billionaires. The founder currently holds over 3 billion XRP tokens , with a 17% stake in Ripple Labs. Number 1008: Winklevoss Twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss made the Forbes list for the first time following their cryptocurrency exchange Gemini’s success . Similar to other cryptocurrency exchanges, the volume has picked up dramatically over the last year. Gemini exchange now processes over $200 million per day in trades. Each of the twins currently has a net worth of $3 billion. The twins have been actively purchasing Bitcoin since 2012, as well as acquiring the NFT platform Nifty Gateway . Playboy recently also announced it would be launching its own NFT art collection on the platform. We’re excited to announce a new partnership with @niftygateway , the premiere platform for NFT art. — Playboy (@Playboy) April 6, 2021 Number 1362: Michael Saylor Perhaps one of the biggest Bitcoin bulls in the last year has to be Michael Saylor. Saylor has been purchasing Bitcoin with every dime he can find. And the gamble appears to have paid off handsomely. Saylor, the CEO of software firm MicroStrategy, makes his first appearance on the Forbes list with a new net worth of $2.3 billion. Over the last six months, the surge in Bitcoin price can be attributed to Saylor’s net worth’s rapid success. 1580: Jed McCaleb Ripple co-founder Jed McCaleb has been involved in the crypto space for many years. Now the founder of Stellar currently holds over 3.4 billion XRP tokens. While also holding over 1 billion XLM tokens. McCaleb joins the list as a newcomer with a combined net worth of $2 billion. 1664: Changpeng Zhao & Fred Ehrsam Joint cryptocurrency exchange founders Fred Ehrsam co-founded Coinbase exchange, and Binance exchange founder Changpeng Zhao come in tied. The pair both clock in with a net worth of $1.9 billion each. Once again, the surge in cryptocurrency users, trading volume, and revenue saw founders of cryptocurrency exchanges climb up the ranks this year. Other Newcomers While the list of cryptocurrency-related billionaires grows, other honorable mentions include Barry Silbert, Tim Draper, and Matthew Roszak. All three are new to the list this year, with net worth reportedly averaging around $1.5 billion each. While the cryptocurrency market is still in its infancy, the industry’s progression has clearly shown the importance of on-ramps within the industry. The cryptocurrency exchange founders benefited the most from the surge in crypto adoption and use. It is extremely likely that 2022 sees more cryptocurrency founders featuring in the Forbes billionaire list .",4,0.9,"The article highlights the significant growth and success of cryptocurrency founders, indicating a positive trend in the industry.",2,0.7,"The inclusion of cryptocurrency founders in the Forbes Billionaires List indicates growing mainstream acceptance, but also highlights potential overvaluation and speculative risks in the crypto market."

Speaking during “First Mover” onWednesday, Schwartz said: “The market considers them similar. We consider them similar.”
Ripple is in the midst of defending itself against a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) action alleging the company and two of its executives violated U.S. securities laws in selling XRP to retail consumers. The SEC action “came out of nowhere,” said Schwartz, who said XRP and cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are “completely different.”

“The market caps of these systems are in the billions of dollars. People acting in their own self-interest are not going to allow the ecosystem to die if there’s a way to save it,” he said. “That’s all that’s holding these systems together.

2021-04-07 22:00:00+00:00,Nexus’s Amanda Marquis: Solving the Blockchain Trilemma,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nexus-amanda-marquis-solving-blockchain-220000240.html,BeInCrypto,"Blockchain has been hounded by the Decentralization Trilemma. This is the idea that a blockchain can only have two of the three qualities: security, scalability, and decentralization. Nexus is creating a blockchain with all three.
BeInCrypto had the pleasure to talk to Amanda Marquis, the web developer at Nexus.
She has been a fan of Nexus for a few years and reached out to the ambassador team to see if they were looking for any new members. She was helping with the community Twitter account, but soon starting working on use-case dApps, the Nexus website. She is now learning the API. She was offered a developer contract at the start of 2021.
The beginnings of the still developing project date back to 2014. The native NXS token istrading at around $1.50, at the time of writing, but has increased almost 800% since the start of the year.
Marquis answered many of our questions aboutNexus essentials, the problems it is trying to solve, the roadmap, innovative technology, interface development, the community, and even the NFT. Let’s dive in!
BeInCrypto: What is Nexus? When was the genesis?
Amanda Marquis:Nexus is a community-driven project with the mission of connecting a decentralized world. We are working on technology that is designed to simplify lives, empower communities, and streamline business while embodying the founding principles of Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of bitcoin (BTC).
Our first NXS block was mined on Sept. 23, 2014, without an ICO or pre-mine. The original Nexus code began as a bitcoin/peercoin fork, however, the entire codebase was rewritten and released with the Tritium Protocol on Nov 5 2019.
Nexus has now evolved into a revolutionary, register-based contract engine. The Tritium Protocol release was the first of three major upgrades for our TAO (Tritium, Amine, Obsidian) Framework.
BeInCrypto:Nexus is working on a 3-Dimensional Chain (3DC). What is it?
Amanda Marquis:The 3DC is designed to solve the Blockchain Trilemma — security, scalability, and decentralization. The Trilemma is the idea that a blockchain can only have two of the three listed qualities. And we do not think that should be the case!
The Nexus 3DC will transform the ledger into a multi-layered processing system, in order to scale securely and with a high degree of decentralization. The 3DC chains together cryptographic primitives into a three-dimensional immutable object (a 3D block), and has three core dimensions: reputation channels (X), immutability or authenticity (Y), and time (Z).
BeinCrypto: What is the Nexus Protocol (NP)?
Amanda Marquis:The Nexus Protocol is our vision of a new internet, driven by a blockchain-based operating system (Nexus’ LX-OS) and routing protocol (Nexus Protocol), connected by a distributed satellite-based mesh network.This protocol would take the internet a step furtherby decentralizing and democratizing the network infrastructure through decentralized hardware and software.
BeInCrypto:What is the LX-OS?
Amanda Marquis:Nexus’ LX-OS is a blockchain-based operating system that is designed to resist attacks and improve user security and ease of use. The first phase will focus on embedded systems (IoT and cube satellites), with the consumer release providing decentralized cloud services, along with an intuitive user experience.
The LX-OS aims to resolve many of the vulnerability issues of today’s operating systems that allows hackers to piggyback malware onto PCs using elevated privileges, by authenticating all changes to the virtual user space across the entire runtime environment.
BeInCrypto:When will the LX-OS and the NP be available, and the satellites for the mesh network launched?
Amanda Marquis:These are long-term goals for Nexus, so we do not have an estimated time of completion and launch for them at this time! Code in production now (LLL-TAO) will be used for the LX-OS and the NP, so work is already in progress for both elements.
They will also be tirelessly tested and evaluated to ensure the best product is released, as this is revolutionary technology in the making! We will be adding these features to our roadmap on the Nexus website in the coming months.
BeInCrypto:What are some short-term goals of Nexus?
Amanda Marquis:We currently have our mobile wallet in open Beta for iOS and Android. The team has been ironing out the back-end code and the full release is on the horizon.
Some key features that will be released in an upcoming release of Tritium ++ include updates to our desktop wallet, release of pooled staking, and various API enhancements including new code for our upcoming P2P Marketplace and DAO.
BeInCrypto:What are some of the features of the mobile wallet?
Amanda Marquis:The Nexus mobile wallet is a lite node built with a focus on reliability and security, using the same modular framework behind the desktop wallet. Themobile wallet eliminates reliance on centralized serversand provides unprecedented access to the Nexus network.
As a lite node, it will not download the entire blockchain history to the device, only storing and processing block headers and the user’s signature chain, starting with the hash of the very first Tritium block hard-coded into the wallet. It holds the same security and privacy as a full node wallet, with a minimal storage, memory, and processor footprint.
BeInCrypto:What is the progress of the P2P Marketplace, and will it be an AMM?
Amanda Marquis:Progress on it is going well! Our P2P marketplace is being built on an entirely new P2P marketplace API. Once completed, anyone will have the ability to use that code to build their own web interface for it.
It will not be an AMM. It willoperate on the traditional exchange approachof buyers and sellers posting their market or limit orders and could be partially or fully filled by anyone. It will also rely on consensus rules and contract logic, meaning the seller can retract their order at any point until it has been fulfilled.
BIC: What is Nexus doing with Quantum Resistance technology?
Amanda Marquis:Our previously mentioned Signature Chains enhance the security of existing DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm), by hashing the public key until it is used while changing the key pair with every transaction.
We have also integrated the following cryptographic functions: FALCON (a second-round contender for the NIST Post-Quantum cryptography competition), Argon2 (winner of the password hashing competition, and a superior alternative to S-Crypt or B-Crypt), and Keccak (winner of the SHA3 competition).
BeInCrypto:Nexus is both proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS). Why?
Amanda Marquis:To keep our project decentralized. Both PoW and PoS have their advantages, and we wanted to make sure that none of our three channels (Two PoW, Hash and Prime, and one PoS) got too centralized. With consensus balanced between all three channels, it makes the network more resistant to 51% attacks.
BeInCrypto:Does Nexus have a maximum supply?
Amanda Marquis:It does not! The initial distribution will create a supply of 78 million NXS, which will end on Sept. 23, 2024. After, it will follow an inflation rate based on the annual inflation rate of gold.
Each PoW channel will increase the NXS supply by 1% per year, and the PoS channel will allow for a maximum of 3% increase, but that would only happen if all NXS in circulation were being staked. It is expected to fall more closely in line with the PoW channels, around 1%.
BeInCrypto:How can people get involved?
Amanda Marquis:There are many ways to get involved with Nexus! We have multiple social media channels, as well as Discord, Telegram, and Slack servers. Sharing Nexus information across a variety of platforms helps spread the word. If someone wants to get involved in a more specific way, we have dedicated workgroups available on Telegram and Slack that focus on different tasks (content, social media, outreach, etc.).
We encourage anyone who is interested in helping in any way to join these workgroups, and we will work together to continue the Nexus vision!
BeInCrypto:How is mass adoption progressing for Nexus?
Amanda Marquis:In recent months, the community has stepped up around the world to increase the adoption of Nexus and usage of NXS for payment. With the mobile wallet in open beta, users are now able to access their Signature Chains on the go, and able to send or receive NXS instantaneously!
It has been awesome to see restaurants and shops starting to accept NXS (most recently in Thailand), and we hope to see many more places in the future do the same!
BeInCrypto:Can you build NFTs on Nexus?
Amanda Marquis:Yes you can! Right now, users are able to create them directly inside our desktop wallet, or by directly interacting with our API through other coded websites or platforms like Bubble.
However, due to our unique TAO framework, we are not supported on NFT Marketplaces at the moment. Once our P2P marketplace is available, there will be alocation to buy and sell NFTs!
BeInCrypto:Thank you for the interview and good luck with further work on this interesting project.

Each of these trusts bears Grayscales name, and the registration gives the same agents address that the firm uses for its real crypto investment vehicles. Grayscale maintains a list of assets that we may potentially include in our family of products, and any further additions will be announced, an external spokesperson said by email. Anyone seeking to confirm an asset Grayscale is considering should refer to this list. Neither nahmii nor theta is on it.

This would have been a significant development had it been true because these registrations are usually a prelude to creating an investment vehicle for a coin. Grayscales trusts attract significant capital from mainstream investors who cant or dont want to go through the hassle of setting up a crypto wallet. All told, the firm manages $27.7 billion in assets through nine active trusts . So a Grayscale registration would be a bullish signal for a coin. But Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein promptly tweeted that the nahmii story was inaccurate, and CoinDesk corrected the story.

The Nahmii team tweeted that it was not in discussions with Greyscale about filing a trust. An email to the address listed on Nahmiis website received a bounceback message. After the publication of this article, representatives from the Theta project told CoinDesk they were not involved in filing the trust registration. Story continues We are very upset to see now that someone else may have done this, Theta Head of Strategy Wes Levitt said. We are talking to our counsel  to see if there is a way to learn who exactly filed this, and what other legal actions are available to us against this person filing what we now consider a fraud. A customer service representative with the Delaware Division of Corporations said the Division would not be able to share any identifying information about who filed the trusts. So for now, the filings origins remain a mystery (no phone number or persons name is in the documents). Dead ringers If the two trusts in question were set up by impostors, it wouldnt be the first such ruse in crypto, though this one would be subtler than usual. Scammers often impersonate influential community figures on Twitter and have pretended to be CoinDesk staff members and spoofed our email newsletters , all in order to trick people into sending them money. The dubious Grayscale Nahmi Trust (here on out, GNT) and Grayscale Theta Trust (GTT) filings were very similar to those of the genuine Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and Grayscale Litecoin Trust (GLTC). For example, they are all registered at 251 Little Falls Drive in Wilmington, Del. (ZIP code 19808). The key difference was in the type of entity set up. While GBTC and GLTC were registered as Statutory Trusts, GNT and GTT were registered as Limited Liability Companies, a detail which raises questions, said Sarah Brennan, a corporate and securities attorney at Harter, Secrest and Emery. Indeed, of the 34 Grayscale trusts registered with the Delaware Division of Corporations, only two were registered as LLCs. These are the entities that Grayscale said it did not set up. Eight of the registered statutory trusts match existing Grayscale products: BTC , BCH , ETH , ETC , ZEN, LTC , XLM and ZCH. A ninth, its XRP Trust, was dissolved earlier this year as a result of a Securities and Exchange Commission suit against Ripple alleging its sales of the cryptocurrency violate federal securities law. Another 23 of the registered statutory trusts are on a list of assets that Grayscale is currently considering, according to a February post on Medium . The remaining two: Theta, filed in February, and Nahmi (again, sans the coins second i), filed in April. Classic crypto Its conceivable these apparently fake entities were set up in hopes the news media would discover and report their existence, with the ultimate goal of pumping the prices of these tokens. This sort of move was almost inevitable, said Brennan, who called it classic crypto marketing. She pointed to a January CoinDesk article about possible future trusts (the article precedes Grayscales Medium post), saying these trust filings easily lead to speculation around whether certain assets might become part of a new investment vehicle. If pumping nahmii was the motive, the plan worked: According to CoinGecko , NIIs price more than doubled on Tuesday after the erroneous CoinDesk article was published, hitting a peak of $0.0148. As of press time, it traded at half that price, around $0.0075. Its still up dramatically over the past month, however. Theta has also risen in price over the past few months, though there doesnt appear to be any correlation between the filing of the fake Grayscale trust and the tokens price. It is difficult to determine the ownership of an entity formed in Delaware, Brennan said. While there are a few limits on what entities can be formed  for example, Delaware might not allow a new entity to be created that has a confusingly similar name to an existing company or product  pretty much anyone can set up an entity in the state, said Brennan, who also leads the digital asset practice at Harter. You can form basically any entity that isnt taken, she said. In Delaware and the other states, their concern is does this entity exist in my state? only. If not, yes you can pay me to set this entity up. Companies can try to prevent this by reserving names for a period of time or registering an entity without having it immediately up and running, she said. CoinDesk has filed a Freedom of Information Act request for the certificates of formation for these Nahmi and Theta LLCs, and had not received a response as of press time. According to the Delaware state website, the government has 15 days to respond. UPDATE (April 8, 2021, 13:45 UTC): Updated with comments from the Theta team.

2021-04-08 04:00:00+00:00,Mark Cuban Says Explosive Growth in DeFi Is 'Like the Early Days of the Internet',https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mark-cuban-says-explosive-growth-040000760.html,Entrepreneur,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) has experienced an unreal uptick unlike amid the chaos of 2020s crumbling global economies.
Last year's warmer months are now known as the “DeFi Summer” because the total value locked into their smart contracts rapidly grew, from a few hundred million to more than $20 billion in a matter of months.
Decentralized Finance, as the name implies, operates independently while not relying on traditional intermediaries such as banks and insurance funds. The need for these intermediaries becomes eliminated, thanks to the user's ability to invest, trade, transfer and conduct peer-to-peer transactions using cryptocurrencies along with digital assets.
Related:This Is Why Bitcoin Will Hit $59,000 In 2021
The first important event that helped make decentralized finance possible was the creation of Bitcoin in 2009 which enabled a default blockchain for all the top DeFi protocols that was Ethereum.
Ethereum launched in 2015 and quickly started attracting developers who wanted to build all kinds of decentralized applications, from financial applications to games (such as the viral CryptoKitties).
Fast forward to 2017, when ICOs on Ethereum became prevalent. This domicile to digital money, global payments and applications have led to some of the most notable DeFi projects of the ICO era. It was from this point forward that it became clear that the public was warming up to DeFi. Billionaire entrepreneurMark Cuban comparedthe growth of DeFi to the early days of the Internet:
“You’re starting to see NFT (non-fungible tokens), and it’s not so much about just about how much is sold, market value, but more just that people are becoming more comfortable with it and so we’re starting to see these applications that are just popping up left and right. It reminded me so much of the early days of the internet where, in the mid-90s, people started talking about internet applications but the internet had been around for ten years.”
Cuban is a believer in DeFi's power and potential, especially considering the new all-time highs of token prices being reached by Ethereum, and so-called “Ethereum killer” protocols such as Polkadot and Solana.
Of course, DeFi isn’t only about the prices of platforms’ native cryptocurrencies. TrustToken, for example, also recently launched its TrueFi protocol for uncollateralized on-chain lending on Binance. The protocol essentially lets people borrow money without locking up their crypto as collateral, which Ethereum requires. TrueFi takes the idea of uncollateralized lending, which exists off the blockchain in the form of high-interest, short-term “text loans,” and improves it through DeFi mechanisms, with transparency as a key component of its offering.
Borrowing and lending are just one of the many capabilities being transformed by DeFi. The growth of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which open the door for people to invest in traditionally non-fungible assets like real estate and art, also represents a promising development in the space and are growing in popularity. Cuban is a huge fan of this particular DeFi segment.
Related:How 2020 Became the Year of DeFi and What's to Come in 2021
There are a few reasons behind the DeFi craze, aside from the elimination of regulators. Another reason is that major asset management funds and high-street financial institutions are getting involved, as they are beginning to accept DeFi and looking for ways to participate. Then there is also the classic case of FOMO—people don’t want to be left out of this explosive growth, especially considering all that the future may have in store for it.
DeFi developers are consistently building new innovative projects, and exploring ways to bring in new users to start participating. Developers are also discovering new use cases that were previously difficult to touch on, due to high network fees.

GameStop shares have risen in premarket trading after saying it intends to elect Ryan Cohen as its next chairman, cementing the activist investor’s influence at the video-game retailer.
Kurtis Wolf resigned effective April 5, GameStop said in a filing Thursday. The company said the resignation didn’t result from a disagreement over operations, policies or practices.
GameStop shares rose as much as 3.8pc to $184.80 in New York premarket trading. The stock has been on a wild, Reddit-driven ride, surging 845pc this year.

Amazon has opened a pair of new supermarkets in the Washington DC metro area, bringing its physical shopping footprint to the doorstep of the US political class (and lobbying community).
The shops are part ofan ever-expanding estatethat includes not only Amazon's advanced Go stores,which use technology to eliminate tills and charge customers as they go, and its more conventional Fresh line, but also Whole Foods, the US health food chain that it acquired in 2017.
Facebookhas begun adding a ""satire"" label to posts from spoof pages in an apparent attempt to reduce misinformation.
The new disclaimers, which are being tested in the US from Thursday, appear on posts shown in users' news feeds and warn users not to confuse them with posts from real public figures or news outlets.
A spokesman said the labels were an experiment designed to find out whether labels can help users distinguish actual elected figures from fakes, with labels for ""public official"" and ""fan page"" also being tested.
More broadly, the disclaimers' wording suggests they are intended to counteract the increasing role of satirical posts in the spread of online misinformation over the past few years.
Stories by parody news sites such as The Onion and the Babylon Bee are frequently shared as if they were real within partisan social media groups,even hoodwinking Donald Trump, whilespoof Antifa Twitter accountsstoked conspiracy theories during last year's Black Lives Matter protests and wildfires in the US.
More recently,parody Twitter accounts mimicking Amazon's controversial employee ""ambassadors"" sowed chaosas critics of the company found them hard to distinguish from the official ones.
Facebook's label says: ""Satire pages [are] a way for people to share social commentary by using humour, exaggeration and absurdity to make a point.
""Posts from satire pages can appear very similar to posts from public figures or conventional news sources. Pages can label themselves as Satire pages to help avoid this conclusion.
""Facebook is providing this information to help you better understand this page.""
The spokesman added that all three labels are currently voluntary, with Facebook checking their accuracy when pages apply them.
The global semiconductor chip shortage has continued for months, and the problem is now affecting broadband suppliers.
It's now taking more than a year to receive new broadband routers, with recent consignments held up in the blockage of the Suez Canal.
Some firms have reported delays of as long as 60 weeks when placing their orders, according to Bloomberg, more than double previous wait times.
Taiwanese router manufacturer Zyxel Communications has since January begun asking customers to order new broadband routers a year in advance to get around the long supply times.

Index Ventures, the prominent venture capital firm with a major presence in London, has announced a new $200m (£145m) fund designed to back early technology companies.
The new Index Origin fund will back fledgling start-ups before they begin to earn revenue.
Index Ventures is known for backing businesses including Deliveroo, Robinhood and Wise (formerly known as Transferwise).
Launching a new early stage fund is a smart way for Index to stake its claim early to future unicorns, placing it in prime position to benefit from any eventual exits.
“Right now, as an early-stage founder, you’re making a trade-off between a multi-stage venture fund that invests in seed or a dedicated seed fund,” said Nina Achadjian, a partner at Index Ventures. “Index Origin offers founders a platform that scales with them, from inception to IPO. By offering seed-specific resources and by encouraging collaboration and co-investment with seed funds and solo general partners, we want to set up founders for success from day one.”
Tesla has today said it is ""irritated"" by administrative delays to the construction of its new gigafactory outside Berlin, and put forward its own reform proposals.
""Tesla has experienced first hand how obstacles in German authorisation procedures slow down industrial transformation,"" the company wrote in a letter to Berlin's highest administrative court seen by AFP.
""If these obstacles are not dealt with quickly, there is a high risk that Germany will miss its climate targets,"" the company added, as it backed a legal case against the government by German environmentalist group DUH.
Arguing that its own experiences with German bureaucracy would be relevant to the case, Tesla said that Germany needed to ""modernise itself"" if it were to meet its target of reducing emissions to 55 percent of 1990 levels by 2030.
Tesla aims to produce 500,000 electric vehicles a year at its first European gigafactory just outside of Berlin, which is slated to begin operations in July this year.
The new site still only has provisional construction permits, but Tesla has been authorised by local officials to begin work at its own risk, pending final authorisation.
Permission has been repeatedly delayed by a series of claims lodged against the company by local environmental groups relating to issues such as water supply and the relocation of wildlife.
Yet Elon Musk's company insisted in the letter that the Berlin gigafactory should be seen as a project which ""helps fight climate change"".
The carmaker set out 10 reform proposals to improve German approval procedures, including more digitalisation and faster procedures for projects judged to be sustainable.
It also backed the legal action by DUH, which is aiming to require the government to impose stricter measures in order to meet its climate goals.
Ramp, a fintech startup that offers corporate cards and software for managing employee expenses, raised $115 million in a funding round led by digital payments giant Stripe and D1 Capital Partners, valuing it at $1.6 billion, it said on Thursday.
The two-year-old New York-based firm competes with American Express, new-age fintech startups such as Brex and older expense management software makers like Expensify and SAP Concur.
Stripe, which had invested in Ramp previously as well, had in March raised $600 million at a valuation of $95 billion. Read more aboutStripe's founders here.
GameStop, which has been part of a recent Reddit-driven trading frenzy, said on Thursday it intends to elect Ryan Cohen, the videogame retailer's biggest shareholder and board member, as chairman following its annual meeting.
Shares of GameStop were up about 3oc in premarket trading.
The company also said it was nominating six people to stand for election to its board at the annual meeting of stockholders on June 9.
Since billionaire Cohen joined GameStop's board in January, he has been pushing towards transformation of the brick-and-mortar retailer into an e-commerce firm that can take on big-box retailers such as Target and Walmart Inc and technology firms such as Microsoft and Sony.
Twitter is refusing to allow the National Archives to make ex-US president Donald Trump’s tweets available on the social media platform.
The National Archives and Records Administration has been working to create an official online archive of Trump’s tweets as president, according to a report inPolitico.
NARA spokesperson James Pritchett said that while the National Archives “is still exploring the best way” to make Trump's tweets public, it would defer to Twitter on whether that archive should be available on the social media site.
It comes after Twitter permanently suspended Mr Trump’s account in January, citing “risk of further incitement of violence.”
Nasa's Perseverance rover has taken a selfie on Mars with the Ingenuity helicopter ahead of its first flight attempt on the red planet.
Ingenuity is aiming to attempt the feat no earlier than 11 April and will undergo several tests over the coming days.
The image was created by stitching together from 62 individual images taken while the rover was looking at the helicopter.
Earlier this week the mini-helicopter wasdropped on the surface of Marsand survived its first night alone on the red planet, which Nasa described as a ""major milestone.""
The ultra-light aircraft had been fixed to the belly of the Perseverance rover, which touched down on the Red Planet on February 18. ""MarsHelicopter touchdown confirmed!"" Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory tweeted over the weekend.
""Its 293 million mile (471 million kilometer) journey aboard @NASAPersevere ended with the final drop of 4 inches (10 centimeter) from the rover's belly to the surface of Mars today. Next milestone? Survive the night.""
A key objective for Perseverance’s mission on Mars isastrobiology, including the search for signs of ancient microbial life. The rover will characterize the planet's geology and past climate, pave the way for human exploration of the Red Planet, and be the first mission to collect and cache Martian rock and regolith.
Twitter has thrown its support behind the Milk Tea Alliance of democracy movements in Hong Kong, Taiwan and other parts of Asia, defying China at a time when Beijing is punishing Western companies for commenting on what it considers internal matters.
The social-media company on Thursday prominently displayed flags of Hong Kong, Taiwan, Myanmar and Thailand while unveiling an emoji to support pro-democracy activists in places that have all seen historic protests in recent years and share a love for the milky, caffeinated drink popular in Asia.
It will automatically show up when users post the MilkTeaAlliance hashtag, which the company said appeared 11 million times since first popping up a year ago.
Max Hodak, the entrepreneur who started brain-computer interface company Neuralink with Elon Musk, beleves we have the technology to recreate Jurassic Park.
“We could probably build jurassic park if we wanted to. wouldn’t be genetically authentic dinosaurs but [shrug]”, Hodak tweeted. “Maybe 15 years of breeding + engineering to get super exotic novel species”.
Neuralink has already implanted chips in the brains of pigs and monkey but it has yet to show off animal cloning.
Facebook has said it will not notify the the more than 530 million users whose personal details were caught up in ahuge data leak.
Business Insider reported last week that phone numbers and other details from user profiles were available in a public database.
Facebook said in a blog post on Tuesday that ""malicious actors"" had obtained the data prior to September 2019 by ""scraping"" profiles using a vulnerability in the platform's tool for synching contacts.
The Facebook spokesman said the social media company was not confident it had full visibility on which users would need to be notified. He said it also took into account that users could not fix the issue and that the data was publicly available in deciding not to notify users. Facebook has said it plugged the hole after identifying the problem at the time.
The scraped information did not include financial information, health information or passwords, Facebook said. However, the collated data could provide valuable information for hacks or other abuses.
Ireland's Data Protection Commission, the European Union's lead regulator for Facebook, said on Tuesday it had contacted the company about the data leak. It said it received ""no proactive communication from Facebook"" but was now in contact.
The Facebook spokesman declined to comment on the company's conversations with regulators but said it was in contact to answer their questions.
You can use third-party tools to find out if you've been affected by the leak. Read more about that here
Revolut, the British digital banking app, will allow its more than 2,000 employees to work overseas for as long as two months per year once Covid travel restrictions have been lifted.
The bank,one of Europe's most valuable start-ups, said those who “wish to work outside their country of employment for personal and non-business related reasons will be able to do so for a period of up to 60 calendar days over a rolling 12 months.""
The policy is a sign of the increasing flexibility some firms are starting to offer their workforces after the pandemic led to a shift toward remote working.
Earlier this week, the government said civil servants will be able to drop into ""hybrid"" office spaces across the country. Meanwhile, HSBC has said that it's moving 1,200 of its call centre staff to permanent home working to reduce office space by 40pc over the next few years.
A survey of Revolut’s staff found that over 56pc would prefer to work from home between two to four times a week, while 36pc wanted an entirely remote job, according to the statement. Only 2pc of respondents said they would prefer to come into the office every day.
Revolut has previously given all employees flexibility to work from home or from the office. People can choose to attend between one and five times a week.
Paypal co-founder Peter Thiel has suggested that Bitcoin should be treated as a ""Chinese financial weapon"", describing the cryptocurrency is a threat to US global power.
The Silicon Valley mega-investor said the US should ask ""tougher questions"" about the rise of Bitcoin, which he warned could undermine the US dollar's status as the world's reserve currency.
The remarks, made during a panel discussion at the Richard Nixon Foundation with Donald Trump's former secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, cut against Mr Thiel's continued support for Bitcoin and his substantial investments in cryptocurrency start-ups.

Nikola, the troubled hydrogen-powered and battery-electric truck startup, lost a key member of its executive team with the departure of the former head of its fuel-cell development program.
The company said Jesse Schneider, executive vice president of technology, hydrogen and fuel cells, left his position on April 1. He had led its engineering teams working on fuel-cell systems, a planned hydrogen-fueling station network and storage technology.
“Jesse Schneider recently departed Nikola on good terms, we understand to pursue a business opportunity in the hydrogen industry,” Mark Russell, Nikola’s chief executive officer, said Wednesday in an emailed statement. “Jesse’s contribution over the last three years included helping Nikola build world-class fuel cell and hydrogen teams.”
Shares of Nikola fell 7opc to close at $12.29 in New York trading -- the lowest since it went public in a reverse merger last year with a blank-check company. The stock is down more than 80pc from its June high.
Apple's App Store fees have caused controversy - and not just with Epic Games.
Other companies have also protested against Apple's cut. Tinder and Netflix have stopped offering subscriptions through the App Store, while Spotify, which competes with Apple’s music service, has lobbied regulators to launch monopoly investigations.
In August, Facebook accused Apple of placing a huge burden on small businesses that are trying to bring more of their services online during lockdown.
In response, Apple agreed to offer a three-month respite of fees for businesses that have been forced to move to online-only events. Here's everything you need to know about how the fees work:
Prosus, the Dutch-listed technology spin-off from Naspers, has confirmed that it has sold part of its stake in Chinese technology giant Tencent.
A Prosus spokesman confirmed that the company sold a 2pc stake in Tencent which earned the business $14.6bn (£10.6bn)
""Prosus intends to use the proceeds of the sale to increase its financial flexibility to invest in growth, plus for general corporate purposes,"" the company said yesterday. It has agreed not to sell any further Tencent shares for three years.
Prosus remains Tencent's largest shareholder with a 29pc stake after the sale.
Apple has accused Epic Games of mounting a carefully planned public relations campaign in a bid to set up its own payment system and app store on the iOS platform.
It claims the Fortnite-maker hired PR companies two years ago to develop a strategy called “Project Library” aimed at portraying Apple “as the bad guy.”
""Epic carefully prepared to launch a media campaign against Apple,” the document alleges. “The battle begins. It’s going to be fun,” an email from an Epic Games employee quoted in the document reads.
It comes after Epic sued Apple last year in a federal court in California, alleging that the so-called 15 to 30pc ""app tax"" Apple charges developers on its App Store gives it gives it control over which apps can be installed on its devices.
The dispute arose after Epic tried to implement its own in-app payment system in the popular ""Fortnite"" game and Apple subsequently banned the game from its App Store.
Apple presented a California federal judge this morning with a road map of how it will push back against Epic in a high-stakes antitrust fight over how much the App Store charges developers.
The filing comes ahead of a May 3 trial before the judge with no jury.
In a summary of its legal arguments, Apple contends the commission it charges developers isn’t anti-competitive as it’s a standard fee charged by online and mobile app platforms.
Epic wants no restrictions on apps, whether on technology or content, accessed through the App Store, Apple said in its filing. But Epic overlooks the benefits of Apple’s app review process such as controlling malware attacks on the iOS platform that have helped developers and consumers, Apple said.
Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook and Epic CEO Tim Sweeney are among company executives that will testify at trial. Both companies have also engaged a small army of economists to lay out their positions to the judge.
For Apple, this countersuit is about defending its position as a fair provider of apps. Epic Games, however, claims it’s abusing that position to bully developers into handing it cash.
Microsoft has dramatically changed its image since its famed US antitrust case in 2001, with the company nowtaking great pains to publicly support governments.
So today’s filing of a £270m antitrust legal claim against the business in the UK is a rarity for modern Microsoft. What’s more unusual is this lawsuit comes from a British business.
ValueLicensing is alleging hundreds of millions of pounds in lost revenues because it claims Microsoft dominates the software world and prevents businesses from reselling software they bought.
Jonathan Horley, the chief executive of the business, claims that “Microsoft’s illegal behaviour has impacted almost every organisation that provides desktop software for its workforce in the UK and the EEA.”
So far, Microsoft has declined to comment on the case, with a spokesman instead saying that the business is “unable to comment on ongoing legal cases.”

BTC is expected to break out from the current trading pattern and attempt to move above the $59,500 resistance area.
Bitcoin has been moving downwards since reaching an all-time high of $61,884 on March 13.
Throughout the decrease, it’s been following a descending resistance line, which so far has rejected BTC three times.
On April 6, BTC was rejected by the line for the third time and began to move downwards. It concluded this move when it reached a local low of $55,473, just above the 0.5 Fib retracement support level.
Despite the bounce, technical indicators do not confirm a bullish reversal.
The main resistance area is found at $59,500, just above this ascending resistance line.
We need to take a look at the shorter-term movement in order to determine if BTC could break out.
The two-hour chart shows that BTC is trading inside a descending parallel channel. This is often acorrective movementthat leads to a breakout in the other direction.
Furthermore, this possibility is supported by technical indicators. TheMACDis already showing a bullish reversal signal and is moving upwards.
Therefore, BTC is expected to break out from the channel.
The ongoing decrease looks to be an A-B-Ccorrective structure, in which waves A:C have a 1:1 ratio.
This is very common in such corrections.
It further supports the possibility that the correction is now complete and the price will break out from the channel. A new all-time high is expected in the near future.

State Street later clarified it is “evaluating” trading on the new platform, but has not committed to doing so.
State Street, the second-oldest bank in the U.S. with $3.1 trillion in assets under management, is providing the infrastructure for a new bank-grade trading platform for digital assets set to go live mid-year — and could eventually use the system for trading itself.
Announced Thursday, State Street’s Currenex trading technology arm is working with London-based Pure Digital, infrastructure provider to the foreign exchange trading world, to create an institution-focused digital currency trading platform.

The two companies said they plan to further explore the digital currency trading space.
“Currenex is thrilled to leverage our experience and expertise in the FX and digital asset trading marketplace to provide Pure Digital with robust technology and infrastructure for this exciting digital currency trading initiative,” David Newns, the global head of Execution Services for State Street Global Markets, said in a statement.
Asked if State Street would be using the platform to do its own crypto trading, Lauren Kiley, CEO of Pure Digital, told CoinDesk over the phone, “That is the intention – State Street is one of the many banks that will be using this platform and we are looking at midway through 2021, although no date is set.” Through a spokesperson, Newns later clarified that State Street is “evaluating” the use of the platform for its own trading, but “we have no statement of commitment.”
Institutions appear to be driving the current crypto bull run, a key difference from the retail-driven expansion of the space back in 2017. Big banks includingBNY Mellon,Goldman SachsandMorgan Stanleyare now making moves, and eyes have been on State Street, as one of the biggest U.S. custody providers and trading operations, to see when/if it would move into crypto.

“The digital currency world needs to grow up and mature,” Campbell Adams, founder of Pure Digital, said in an interview, adding:
“It needs large-balance financial institutions involved in the manufacturing process of price. The primary market doesn’t really exist. There’s a lot of disparate exchanges out there with different rules of engagement and systems. And this manifests itself in very fragmented market data.”
The plan is to transpose FX infrastructure to the crypto space via a bank-led consortium, and a platform that includes FX-industry standard APIs and best execution, Kiley said.
“State Street has agreed to explore the digital asset space trading space with us, and is also working with us on the tech,” Kiley told CoinDesk in an interview. “We’ve got a couple of banks that have signed with us and several others in the pipeline.”
Unlike a crypto exchange, Pure Digital is building an over-the-counter (OTC) offering with bilateral credit lines and full transparency, so that top-tier banks can see exactly with whom they’re dealing and can turn on and off counterparties as they choose, Kiley added.
“All these banks are waking up to crypto and can’t ignore it anymore, “ Kiley said. “Either they find a way to get involved and provide services to meet client demand or they will start to lose relevancy over time.”

2021-04-08 08:38:00+00:00,"Global Blockchain Technology Market Report 2021-2027 - Born Out of Bitcoin, Blockchain Technology Emerges to Disrupt the Digital Economy",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-blockchain-technology-market-report-083800543.html,GlobeNewswire,"Dublin, April 08, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The""Blockchain Technology - Global Market Trajectory & Analytics""report has been added toResearchAndMarkets.com'soffering.The Pandemic Highlights Blockchain's Potential Role in Increasing Resilience of Business Communities & Ecosystems. The Market to Reach US$ 30.7 Billion.The global market for Blockchain Technology is projected to reach US$ 30.7 billion by the year 2027, trailing a post COVID-19 CAGR of 43% over the analysis period 2020 through 2027.
At a time when the global economic climate is spinning out of control, the blockchain technology market is expected to face severe short-term challenges in the year 2020. This year is expected to end on a dismal note as the pandemic continues to rage through the globe flaring up in second and third waves of infections, each worse than the previous wave, continuing to cause large scale human and financial destruction in countries across the world.
Pessimism remains high among chief information officers (CIOs). The continued decline in business confidence is an indication of the gradually worsening economic climate, since business confidence is a well-known leading indicator of future output. Business confidence, in other words, is a barometer of investment growth. As companies revisit their Investment spending plans, its little surprise that IT budgets are being slashed.
IT budgets which in the pre-pandemic period was projected to grow by over 5.5% to 6.8% supported largely by enterprise software spending is now set for sharp downward revisions. This downward revision comes despite the fact that the pandemic has set into motion a digital transformation wave. While emerging technologies like AI, IoT, automation, big data, and blockchain will benefit in the post COVID-19 period as essential technologies to have to ensure resilience to future disruptions, they currently come under the non-essential bracket especially for companies struggling to survive and remain afloat.Virtually every technology company is facing financial challenges of disrupted supply chains, business opportunities and low consumer demand for goods and services. Inability to meet quarterly revenue targets mean reduced available funds for planned IT projects.
Over 45% to 55% of CIOs expect negative impact on IT budgets in the range of -10% to -40% as compared to the less than 20% who expect spending to actually increase. Excluding automation, cloud computing and technologies for remote working which are high priority as businesses come under pressure to enable WFM and remote operation to ensure business continuity, all other IT spending are being slashed. Blockchain technology will witness decline in all application areas, industrial and non-industrial sectors.
While blockchain is witnessing dwindling investments, these glitches are likely to be transitory and the technology is anticipated to spring back relatively quickly than other legacy options. The technology is estimated to witness the highest level of spending over the coming years owing to its intriguing characteristics like redundancy, decentralization and transparency. These aspects are bound to push blockchain adoption across a diverse spectrum of domains, from financial services and healthcare to supply chains.
The technology is expected to experience increasing interest and spending across various applications and industry verticals for addressing concerns associated with traditional options, enabling companies to gain an edge over competitors. The technology has become an integral part of business-to-business and business-to-consumer commerce, products and legal processes. Blockchain holds significant potential for prescription management, medical data, online shopping and other areas.The technology is likely to help companies in controlling supply chains, achieving traceability of products and maintaining auditable record of goods movement. Blockchain is anticipated to present new opportunities for participants to manage supply chains, track insurance records and verify medical data. Despite certain degree of reluctance, the technology is poised to find increasing acceptance across manufacturing and professional services companies in the post-pandemic era. The technology is estimated to receive a notable investment of $14.4 billion globally by 2023.
The manufacturing & resources sector is estimated to register the fastest growth of 60.5% in terms of blockchain spend, followed by the distribution & services sector, which is forecast to post a solid CAGR of around 58.7%. Despite modest level of risks across majority of industries, blockchain-related deployments are slated to increase in the professional services, healthcare, manufacturing and retail industries owing to the requirement for coordination through the value chain.
Regionally, the US is anticipated to remain at forefront of blockchain spending. Following slowdown, blockchain spend in majority of regions is likely to increase notably over 2018-2023, with Central and Eastern Europe & Western Europe leading from the front with a CAGR of more than 63%. Asia-Pacific is estimated to contribute nearly 19.3% of the total spending on blockchain technology in 2020.
The regional market is expected to be fueled by increasing investments in the BFSI sector. The technology is anticipated to receive a major stimulus from increasing focus of various countries in Asia-Pacific to improve existing payment techniques and maintain records associated with regulatory compliance.

2021-04-08 09:30:00+00:00,Peter Thiel: China Using Bitcoin as a ‘Financial Weapon’,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/peter-thiel-china-using-bitcoin-093000576.html,BeInCrypto,"Peter Thiel, billionaire venture capitalist, and PayPal co-founder advised the U.S. government to consider tighter regulations on cryptocurrencies.
Thiel made these comments after he expressing worry the Chinese are using bitcoin to corrode the U.S. financial system.
Thiel gave his more-than-skeptical sounding comments at avirtual roundtablefor members of the Richard Nixon Foundation on April 7.
“Even though I’m a pro-crypto, pro-bitcoin maximalist person, I do wonder whether at this point, bitcoin should also be thought [of] in part as a Chinese financial weapon against the U.S,” said Thiel.
Thiel’s comment on the potential use of bitcoin as a “Chinese financial weapon” was followed by his forecast of its threat to fiat money and the U.S. dollar specifically.
This comes asChina recently trialedits central bank-issued digital currency (CBDC). According to Thiel, this “internal stablecoin” will amount to nothing other than, “some sort of totalitarian measuring device”. However, he did urge U.S. policymakers to consider these crypto-forward moves from a geopolitical point of view.
This is not the first time Thiel has leaned skeptical towards China. In late 2019, the venture capitalist repeatedlybacked the San Francisco-based startup, Layer1. This was a bid to elevate the U.S. as a mining hotbed against the Chinese and its bitcoin mining monopoly.
Thiel isn’t the only one to take a stance against China’s potential intentions with digital currencies. Recently, celebrity investor and chairman of O’Shares ETFs, Kevin O’Leary,refused to acceptany bitcoin mined in China.
Although O’Leary did not specifically call China’s crypto frenzy a threat to the U.S., he was sure to recall out the human rights abuses committed by China and its continuing trade war with the U.S.

“Mr. Fowler’s prior counsel withdrew from the case because they were not being paid. Do you understand that?” said U.S. District Judge Andrew L. Carter Jr. during a virtual hearing, as cited in the report. Sapone said he understood and thanked Carter for bringing it to his attention.
Fowler is one of two individuals accused of operating a “shadow banking” service for cryptocurrency exchanges. The pair allegedly acted under the false pretense of processing real estate transactions by opening bank accounts with various financial institutions to illegally store funds for the exchanges.

Enjin Coin (ENJ) bounced on April 7 and is attempting to reach a new all-time high price.
Polkadot (DOT) has broken out from a descending resistance line and is attempting to reclaim the $41.50 resistance area.
CREAM has been moving downwards since Feb. 14, when it reached an all-time high price of $380.
The drop was swift, culminating with a low of $94.70 on March 17.
CREAM has been moving upwards since.
On April 1, it managed to reclaim the $125 area, which had previously acted as resistance. This is a bullish development that suggests higher prices are on the horizon.
Furthermore, technical indicators are bullish. The MACD is increasing, as are theRSIand Stochastic oscillator. The RSI has just crossed above the 50 line and validated it as support.
Therefore, CREAM is expected to increase at least to the next resistance at $236.
• CREAM has reclaimed the $125 support area.
• Technical indicators in the daily time frame are bullish.
ENJ has been increasing parabolically since Feb. 23. On March 15, it managed to reach an all-time high price of $3.08. This amounted to an increase of 762% in only 20 days.
The decrease that followed was gradual and ENJ initiated another upward move on April 7.
The RSI has generated ahidden bullish divergence. Furthermore, the MACD has just crossed into positive territory.
If ENJ reaches a new all-time high price, which seems likely, the next resistance would be found at $3.81.
• ENJ has nearly reached a new all-time high price.
• The RSI has generated a hidden bullish divergence.
DOT has been increasing since March 24, when it traded at a local low of $27.45.
The upward movement that followed caused a breakout from a descending resistance line that had been in place since the previous all-time high.
In turn, this caused a new all-time high price of $46.80 to be reached on April 3.
Afterward, DOT returned to validate the prior descending resistance line. Currently, it’s attempting to reclaim the $39.50 level.
The movement that caused the breakout (highlighted in green) does look like the beginning of a new impulse. Therefore, DOT is expected to be successful in reclaiming the $41.50 area and gradually move towards the $52 and $68 levels.
This is also supported by a bullish cross in theStochastic oscillator.

2021-04-08 10:02:30+00:00,"‘We could probably build Jurassic Park,’ says co-founder of Elon Musk’s Neuralink",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/could-probably-build-jurassic-park-100230538.html,The Independent,"(Photo by Fausto García-Menéndez) Neuralink co-founder Max Hodak, who started the brain-computer interface company with Elon Musk , has claimed that humans have the technology to recreate Jurassic Park . “We could probably build jurassic park if we wanted to. wouldn’t be genetically authentic dinosaurs but [shrug]”, Hodak tweeted. “Maybe 15 years of breeding + engineering to get super exotic novel species”. It is unclear who Hodak is referring to when he says “we”. Neuralink has demonstrated a chip implanted into the brain of a pig and a monkey , but does not appear to have made any announcements with regards to animal cloning. If Hodak is referring to scientists and genetic researchers as a whole, the prospect becomes more feasible – although is undeniably difficult. Scientists have cloned a number of animals, including wolves, dogs, cats, monkeys and, famously, sheep. A black-footed ferret, which is on the US endangered species list, has also been cloned , but scientists have not managed to create an extinct animal yet.

But why do we stop there? Why don’t we more intentionally try to generate novel diversity?” Hodak also tweeted. The challenge in creating genetically authentic dinosaurs is due to the fact that soft material which would contain DNA is hard to preserve. “We do have mosquitos and biting flies from the time of the dinosaurs and they do preserve in amber. But when amber preserves things, it tends to preserve the husk, not the soft tissues. So you don’t get blood preserved inside mosquitos in amber”, Dr Susie Maidment, a dinosaur researcher at the Natural History Museum, has said . Story continues It is possible that a small insect, such as a mosquito or fly, could be used to extract DNA but even in the unlikely event that blood or soft tissue is found that is no guarantee of the necessary genetic material needed for cloning. Breeding and engineering, as Hodak suggests, is a possibility – albeit one that relies on a much greater understanding of the genome. In the film Jurassic Park , they used DNA from a frog to replicate a reptile, but scientists do not currently know where the holes are in an animal’s genome if the animal no longer exists. “A genome is the complete set of DNA of a living thing. Without the full genome, it would be impossible to tell which parts of the DNA have been found and therefore impossible to fill the gaps to build a whole animal,” Dr Maidment said. “But if you did have the whole genome and you were going to fill the holes in fragments, then you definitely wouldn’t do it with frogs, because frogs are amphibians. If you were going to do it, you’d use bird DNA, because birds are dinosaurs. Or you might do it with crocodile DNA, because they share a common ancestor.” Scientists are attempting to bring back similar species that have gone extinct, such as cloning a “proxy” species of mammoth from an Asian elephant where there is a large amount of DNA material available. Even then, however, the process might not be the optimum way to conserve nature. “If it works, de-extinction will only target a few species and it’s very expensive. Will it divert conservation dollars from true conservation measures that already work, which are already short of funds?” posed David Ehrenfeld, professor of biology at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, to The Independent in 2015 . “At this moment brave conservationists are already risking their lives to protect dwindling groups of African forest elephants from heavily-armed poachers, and here we are talking about bringing back the woolly mammoth.

2021-04-08 11:00:00+00:00,The NFT Gold Rush: Here's Why Everyone Is Talking About Non-Fungible Tokens,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nft-gold-rush-heres-why-110000577.html,Entrepreneur,"The crypto market moves in waves. Bitcoin remains the undisputed blockchain industry leader, but as the major banks and investment funds accumulate BTC, retail investors always try to find “the next big thing” that would be able to repeat the unparalleled success of the original cryptocurrency.
First it was altcoins, then it was ICOs (which was another name for altcoins), in 2020 it was DeFi (which was yet another name for altcoins). NFTs can already be declared the most popular crypto trend of 2021. But unlike the previous fads, NFTs are not just rebranded altcoins - they have a unique use case, and they might stay here for longer.
What are NFTs?
One of the reasons for the rapid rise of the popularity of NFTs is that it’s very easy for everyone to immediately get what they’re all about. Imagine collectibles like baseball cards, or works of art like paintings, only stored in the form of tokens on a blockchain. That’s what NFTs essentially are: digital collectibles kept on a decentralized ledger.
Related:What Is an NFT? Inside The Next Billion-Dollar Crypto Sensation.
The word NFT is an abbreviation of “Non-Fungible Token”. Typical cryptocurrency tokens, like the thousands of altcoins launched on the Ethereum network, are all fungible. This simply means that 1 XYZ token in your wallet is worth exactly the same as 1 XYZ in anyone else’s wallet. It’s the same with traditional currencies like euro or dollar: 1 USD in your bank account has the same value as 1 USD in somebody’s pocket.
The word “non-fungible” means that all NFTs are unique, and each of them has a different, individual value. Simply put, NFTs are collectibles very similar in nature to traditional baseball trading cards. A common card can be worthless, but a very rare card can be worth millions.
NFTs are by no means a new thing. The first NFT project called CryptoPunks was launched in 2017. Originally, 10,000-pixel art characters named CryptoPunks were created, and anyone with an Ethereum wallet could claim one for themselves for free - back then, NFTs weren’t considered a business opportunity but a silly novelty only intended to make crypto a little bit more popular.
The first NFT project which gained wider recognition was CryptoKitties. CryptoKitties weren’t really that much different from CryptoPunks - the only difference was that instead of collecting pixel art “punks”, the users collected digital pets.
For a few years, projects like CryptoKitties were only enjoyed by a small number of Ethereum enthusiasts. NFTs weren’t really considered an investment back then. They were just fun collectibles that utilized the new, exciting blockchain technology.
The situation changed in 2020, with the advent of DeFi (decentralized finance) solutions. DeFi developers reinvented Non-Fungible Tokens, and soon started to find new applications for what was once considered a mere novelty.
The NFT projects of today are much more advanced than the original CryptoPunks and CryptoKitties. Thanks to smart contracts technology, almost anything can be tokenized and stored on the blockchain, and NFTs that are created now can be very complex.

A good example is the NFT virtual painting of the Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin entitled “EthBoy”, which sold for 260 ETH (almost $500,000 with today’s prices). EthBoy is much more than just an image stored on the blockchain - it is a fully interactive work of art that changes its appearance every day based on external data such as the ETH price and Ethereum gas fees.
The groundbreaking moment in the history of NFTs happened when Twitter founder Jack Dorsey sold the NFT of the first tweet he ever made for $2.9 million. Suddenly, everyone realized that there’s money to be made with Non-Fungible Tokens, and celebrities like Lil Pump, Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton started selling their own NFTs. Even Elon Musk tweeted about selling an NFT, but he eventually turned down all the offers.
Perhaps even more important than individual celebrities selling NFTs is the fact that many reputed companies are now launching their licensed NFT projects. The two best examples are NBA Top Shot and Sorare, which allow people to trade virtual baseball and football cards respectively.

The NFTs are getting more advanced and complex. Currently, many companies are working on utilizing NFTs to create blockchain-based video games, which could make Non-Fungible Tokens even more popular. Unlike the ICO craze of 2018, the NFT phenomenon is built on unique technologic fundamentals. Who knows, maybe in the future owning an NFT project will become as common as owning a website?",4,0.85,"The article highlights the growing popularity and potential of NFTs, presenting them as a significant and innovative trend in the crypto market with positive future implications.",3,0.75,"The rapid rise and speculative interest in NFTs could divert investment and attention from Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, potentially leading to market volatility."

The leading cryptocurrency has spent the better part of the last three weeks trading in the range of $50,000 to $60,000. The consolidation has worsened of late, with bitcoin bulls unwilling to lead the price action above $60,000 and bears struggling to force a break below $55,000.
Due to the persistent lack of clear directional bias, the Bollinger bandwidth, a price volatility gauge, has declined to a four-month low of 0.15. Bitcoin (BTC) witnessed big moves during the 2017 bull run each time the bandwidth fell to 0.15.
Related:Coinbase Joins DeFi Alliance Ahead of Public Listing
The indicator is calculated by dividing the spread between the Bollinger bands by the 20-day average of the cryptocurrency’s price. Bollinger bands are volatility lines placed two standard deviations above and below the 20-day average of price.
The metric dropped to around 0.15 in February, April and late October 2017, just before price rallies. A similar reading in March, July and September paved the way for market corrections.
The data tells us the impending volatility explosion is agnostic to price direction, meaning the big move can happen on either side.
Bitcoin’s ongoing range play looks quite similar to the early December consolidation below $20,000, which ended with a breakout following the Bollinger bandwidth falling to 0.15.

While theseasonalityfor April is biased bullish, some analysts say the market looks overstretched. “Everyone who’s been in crypto for a while can recognize that things have been getting absolutely ridiculous on every level,” trader and analystAlex Kruger tweetedon Wednesday.
Therefore, the impending big move could be bearish in nature. At press time, bitcoin is trading 1% higher on the day near $56,500, as per CoinDesk 20 data.

• Additional eight new highly efficient locations in development worldwide
• All newly developed sites are entirely based on renewable energy sources
FRANKFURT, GERMANY / ACCESSWIRE / April 8, 2021/ Northern Data AG (XETRA:NB2, ISIN:DE000A0SMU87), a leading developer and operator of High-Performance-Computing (""HPC"") infrastructure solutions, sells its U.S. subsidiary Whinstone Inc., which operates a high-performance data center facility based in Rockdale, Texas, to Riot Blockchain Inc. (NASDAQ: ""RIOT""), one of the largest U.S. based publicly-traded bitcoin miners in North America. The consideration in the transaction consists of EUR 67 million in cash component (cash and debt-free) and 11.8 million shares of common stock of Riot Blockchain Inc., which, based on the Riot Blockchain Inc. last closing share price (record date April 7, 2021: USD 48.37), corresponds to a total value of EUR 481 million. Consequently, the total volume of the transaction amounts to approximately EUR 548 million. Upon closing of the transaction, Northern Data AG will own approximately 12% of the total outstanding common stock of Riot Blockchain Inc.
Northern Data AG pursues a multi-site strategy with strong focus on value-accretive HPC business. The Company's leadership in cost, speed, availability and scale maximizes hardware profitability and is rewarded by adequate profit share agreements as well as fix base remunerations.
The Company pursues a clear strategic roadmap using the transaction proceeds to further expand its six existing HPC locations in Canada, Germany, the Netherlands and Scandinavia, including the new ultra-efficient Boden Facility in Sweden. Given all sites in operation and construction are already sold out, the proceeds will allow Northern Data to directly accelerate the development of eight new HPC locations in North America and Europe. Concerning the eight new sites in development, the Company further diversifies geographically and will expand even beyond in the coming years.
The sites stand out by time to market of 2-4 months, data sovereignty principles, tier 3 DC standards and sustainability attributes such as renewable energy usage of >90%, mild climate (around 6 degrees C) and Northern Data's proprietary software-controlled cooling solution leading to an above-market standard power usage effectiveness (PUE) of around 1.04. All newly developed sites are entirely green and the Company is building towards a circular ecosystem.
The Company's strategic roadmap is set and the corresponding growth goals for the next years are already covered by the new sites in planning as well as the placed hardware orders. As a result, the Company will be able to meet the exponentially growing customer demand for high-performance computing power for a broad range of applications, including artificial intelligence, autonomous driving, graphics rendering, blockchain businesses such as Bitcoin mining and other scientific use cases.
Riot intends to not only utilize Whinstone's existing operational capacity for their own mining operations but also to scale capacity and establish themselves as the leading Bitcoin miner in the US. By becoming a minority shareholder in Riot going forward, through its equity stake in Riot, Northern Data will be able to benefit from the synergies generated by the transaction and continues to directly participate in the growth of Bitcoin value potential.
""Northern Data has been able to create a versatile multi-site network of efficient HPC capabilities with an industry-leading sustainability focus by offering secured access to renewable energy sources. With the proceeds from the transaction, we can accelerate our expansion significantly and reinforce the focus on value-accretive HPC services,"" said Aroosh Thillainathan, CEO of Northern Data AG.
Due to the strong, profitable growth of the other data center sites the operating EBITDA forecast for 2021 in the order of EUR 100 million to EUR 125 million remains unchanged. The operating EBITDA forecast includes the YTD business performance, but no one-off effects from the transaction and effects from the current fiscal year of Whinstone US Inc. in the order of a mid-three-digit million-euro range. Accordingly, the reporting of Northern Data AG will be continued without the consolidation of Whinstone US Inc. in the future. The company now expects to generate revenues in the amount of EUR 285 million to EUR 325 million in fiscal year 2021. Originally, revenues of EUR 350 million to EUR 400 million and EBITDA of EUR 100 million to EUR 125 million were forecast. For the years to come, management expects a continuation of the strong profitable growth.

2021-04-08 11:47:00+00:00,"Riot to Acquire Whinstone, Creating a US-Based Industry Leader in Bitcoin Mining",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/riot-acquire-whinstone-creating-us-114700823.html,GlobeNewswire,"Combination of leading US-based Bitcoin miner with owner and operator of America’s largest Bitcoin hosting facility will create leading US-based corporate pillar in support of the Bitcoin mining network
Castle Rock, CO, April 08, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --Riot Blockchain, Inc. (NASDAQ: RIOT) (""Riot”, “Riot Blockchain” or the “Company"")announced today that it has signed a definitive agreement pursuant to which Riot will acquire Whinstone US, Inc. (“Whinstone”), including all of its assets and operations, for consideration of $80 million cash plus a fixed 11.8 million shares of Riot common stock, equal to an implied total transaction value of approximately $651 million based on Riot’s last closing price of $48.37.
• Whinstone is the owner and operator of North America’s largest Bitcoin hosting facility, with 300 MW in developed capacity and an attractive long-term power purchase agreement
• Diversifies Riot’s revenues and catapults Riot into a market-leading position in the Bitcoin mining and hosting business
• Creates significant financial and operational synergies for Riot
• Provides a clear, and significantly de-risked, path to growth for Riot, as Whinstone’s facility can be rapidly expanded by an additional 450 MW
• Transaction valued at $651 million, $80 million payable in cash and remainder in shares of Riot common stock
The acquisition of Whinstone is a transformative event for Riot and its shareholders. Riot views Whinstone as a foundational element in its strategy to become an industry-leading Bitcoin mining platform, on a global scale. Upon the closing of this acquisition, Riot is expected to be the largest publicly-traded Bitcoin mining and hosting company in North America, as measured by total developed capacity.
“The acquisition of Whinstone is the most significant achievement in Riot’s growth to-date and positions Riot as an industry leader in Bitcoin mining,” said Jason Les, CEO of Riot. “After the consummation of this transaction, we will have created a very clear path for the Company’s future growth. Riot will wholly own the largest Bitcoin mining facility in North America, with very low power costs, and one of the most talented development teams in the industry. Whinstone will serve as the foundation of Riot’s Bitcoin mining operations, upon which we will drive our goal of increasing the American footprint in the global Bitcoin mining landscape.”
Riot will be able to continue rapidly scaling its self-mining business with Whinstone’s industry-leading team. Led by Chad Harris, the Whinstone team has become an industry-leading developer and operator of Bitcoin hosting facilities over the past two years, as Bitcoin mining has reached institutional scale. The Whinstone team is comprised of approximately 100 employees who have built Whinstone’s Texas operations from greenfield to commercialization in less than twelve months. The talented Whinstone team, combined with the facility’s substantial expansion capacity significantly de-risks Riot’s future operational and financial growth.
Whinstone is based in Rockdale, Texas and its facility is located on an 100-acre site, hosting Bitcoin mining customers in three buildings totaling 190,000 square feet. An additional 60,000 square foot building is also under development. The site is subject to a long-term lease agreement, with electricity provided via a long-term power supply contract.
Whinstone’s site has a total power capacity of 750 MW, with 300 MW currently developed. Whinstone’s facility is believed to be the largest single facility, as measured by developed capacity, in North America for Bitcoin mining. In pursuit of achieving the most efficient power strategy, Whinstone combines fixed low-cost power agreements, real-time spot power procurement and income from ancillary power services revenue. Bitcoin miners benefit from low-cost energy to maximize production margins, benefiting from an electricity supply with the flexibility to respond rapidly to supply and demand events in the power market.
Whinstone currently hosts Bitcoin mining operations for three institutional clients who, by the end of 2021, are expected to utilize up to 300 MW of aggregate power capacity. In addition to hosting revenue, Whinstone generates engineering and construction services revenue from hosting clients on site, including revenue derived from the fabrication and deployment of immersion cooling technology for Bitcoin mining.
“We are excited to be joining Riot, as both Riot and Whinstone share a vision for the future of Bitcoin mining in America,” said Chad Harris, co-founder of Whinstone. “Riot’s strategic vision and resources combined with Whinstone’s infrastructure strength will allow our combined teams to achieve our shared growth plans.”
Northern Data AG, a leading developer and operator of High-Performance-Computing (“HPC”) infrastructure solutions, acquired Whinstone in 2020 and has successfully demonstrated its set of capabilities in establishing one of the world’s largest HPC centers.
“With Whinstone we have built and established one of the largest HPC centers in the world with significant potential and scale to further ramp up capacity. The transaction will provide Riot with the opportunity to not only utilize Whinstone’s existing operational capacity for their own mining operations but also to scale capacity and establish themselves as the leading bitcoin miner in the US. By becoming a minority shareholder in Riot going forward, through its equity stake in Riot, Northern Data will be able to benefit from the synergies generated by the transaction and continues to directly participate in the growth of Bitcoin value potential. Simultaneously, Northern Data will be able to use the cash proceeds from the transaction to focus on, and further implement, its decentralized, multi-site, scalable and ESG-focused strategy. The transaction will allow both companies to further strengthen their respective core businesses and to substantially accelerate their strategies,” said Aroosh Thillainathan, CEO of Northern Data.
Upon closing of the transaction, Northern Data will own approximately 12% percent of the total outstanding common stock of Riot.
The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2021, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory clearances.
XMS Capital Partners, LLC is serving as exclusive financial advisor and Sidley Austin LLP is serving as legal advisor to Riot.
Riot will host a live conference call at 8:30 am ET on April 8, 2021 to discuss the transaction. Further details may be found atwww.tinyurl.com/RiotIR. The presentation will also be available on the Riotwebsite.

2021-04-08 12:36:40+00:00,PayPal founder Peter Thiel calls bitcoin a ‘Chinese financial weapon’,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paypal-founder-peter-thiel-calls-123640898.html,The Independent,"Peter Thiel pictured in at the National Press Club on 31 October, 2016 in Washington, DC (Getty Images) PayPal founder and Donald Trump loyalist Peter Thiel has claimed that China is using bitcoin as a “financial weapon” to undermine the US dollar. Speaking at a virtual panel event for the Richard Nixon Foundation this week, the billionaire said bitcoin posed a threat to traditional fiat currency and that it “especially threatens the US dollar”. Mr Thiel also said he is a “bitcoin maximalist”, meaning he believes the cryptocurrency is superior to all other alternative digital currencies like ethereum (ether) or litecoin. However, he questioned China’s involvement in bitcoin, where around two thirds of all cryptocurrency mining takes place. “From China’s point of view, they don’t like the US having this reserve currency because it gives us a lot of leverage over Iranian oil supply chains and all sorts of things like that,” he said.

More on cryptocurrencies from The #NixonSeminar : pic.twitter.com/sIUQTQEWgr — Richard Nixon Foundation (@nixonfoundation) April 7, 2021 Mr Thiel also said that China’s efforts to launch its own state-backed digital currency was “not a real cryptocurrency”, adding, “that’s just some sort of totalitarian measuring device”. Story continues China first began exploring the possibility of creating its own cryptocurrency in 2014, while simultaneously cracking down on bitcoin exchanges and trading activity in the country. A new law passed last year signalled a U-turn in China’s approach towards cryptocurrency, and paved the way for the launch of a digital yuan controlled by its central bank. “This is a clear signal that the leader of the world’s second-largest economy is moving towards embracing the technology – in which bitcoin plays a vital part – and therefore taken as a positive boost for the whole digital currencies sector,” Nigel Green, CEO of financial advisory firm deVere Group, told The Independent at the time. The digital yuan will streamline payments in the world’s second largest economy, however privacy advocates have also warned that it will also offer the state an unprecedented view into its citizens’ spending habits.",2,0.85,"The article presents a negative view on bitcoin's role as a potential financial weapon against the US, despite the speaker's general support for cryptocurrency.",3,0.75,"The portrayal of Bitcoin as a potential Chinese financial weapon introduces geopolitical tensions and uncertainty, which could affect investor sentiment and market stability."

Meanwhile, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said the coronavirus pandemic will weigh on Euro Zone growth over the coming months but longer-term risks are receding and growth will pick up once lockdown measures can be lifted.
In the United States, first-time claims for unemployment insurance rose more than expected last week despite other signs of healing in the jobs market, the Labor Department reported Thursday.
First-time claims for the week ended April 3totaled 744,000, well above the expectation for 694,000 from economists surveyed by Dow Jones. The total represented an increase of 16,000 from the previous week’s upwardly revised 728,000.
At 12:47 GMT, theEUR/USDis trading 1.1886, up 0.0016 or +0.14%.
The European Union’s statistics office Eurostat said prices at factory gates in the 19 countries sharing the Euro rose 0.5% month-on-month for a 1.5% year-on-year rise.
Finally, Lagarde said in a statement that echoes the bank’s policy stance after its March meeting, “Overall, the risks surrounding the Euro Area growth outlook have become more balanced, although downside risks associated with the pandemic remain in the near term.”
The main trend is down according to the daily swing chart, however, momentum has been trending higher since the formation of the closing price reversal bottom on March 31.
The main trend will change to up on a trade through 1.1989. A move through 1.1704 will negate the reversal bottom and signal a resumption of the downtrend.
The minor trend is up. This confirms the shift in momentum. On Thursday, a new minor top was formed at 1.1915.
The EUR/USD is currently testing a retracement zone at 1.1888 to 1.1976. This zone is resistance, but it’s also controlling the near-term direction of the common currency.
On the downside, a pair of 50% levels at 1.1847 and 1.1801 are support.
The direction of the EUR/USD is likely to be determined by trader reaction to 1.1888.
A sustained move over 1.1888 will indicate the presence of buyers. The next target is the minor top at 1.1915. Taking out this level could trigger an acceleration to the upside with a price cluster at 1.1947, 1.1976, 1.1989 and 1.1990. The latter is a potential trigger point for another acceleration to the upside with 1.2243 the next likely target.
A sustained move under 1.1888 could lead to a labored break with potential targets coming in at 1.1847 and 1.1801. The latter is a potential trigger point for an acceleration to the downside with targets coming in at 1.1738 and 1.1704.

2021-04-08 13:23:29+00:00,EUR/USD Price Forecast – Euro Continues to Go Sideways,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eur-usd-price-forecast-euro-132329061.html,FX Empire,"TheEurohas rallied a bit to kick off the trading session on Thursday but continues to see resistance above. That being the case, the market looks as if it is going to be susceptible to selling pressure yet again, as we have been in a downtrend for several months. That being said, there are a lot of questions out there about where the US dollar goes next, and of course interest rates in America will have a huge influence on where we end up.
At the same time though, most retail traders have not been paying attention to the fact that the ECB has jumped into the bond market and started buying hand over fist. That drives down rates in the European Union, so it still favors the greenback from a yield standpoint. Because of this, I would not be surprised at all to see this market reached down towards the 1.16 level again, and therefore I am looking for selling opportunities. The 1.16 level has been massive support in the past and should be in the future. I believe there is roughly a 100 point zone of support between the 1.16 level at the 1.15 level, so I think of this more or less as the “floor the market.”
If we were to break down below the 1.15 handle, it is hard to tell where this would end up, but it certainly would be several handles below. In the short term, I think it makes quite a bit of sense that we get this pullback, and then perhaps grind back and forth. If we were to break above the 50 day EMA, then I think the market is probably going to go chasing the 1.20 level above.

Icon (ICX) has broken out above the $2.30 resistance level and is now validating it as support.
IOTA (IOTA) has completed arunning flat correction.
PancakeSwap (CAKE) has broken out from the $19 resistance area.
BTC has been moving downwards since April 2, when the $59,500 resistance area rejected it.

Furthermore, both the short-term RSI & MACD have generated bullish divergence.
Therefore, BTC is expected toeventually break outfrom this channel.

XRP increased rapidly after breaking out on April 4.
Despite the increase, it is currently retracing in the short-term.
The decrease resembles afourth wave pullback.Afterward, this move has a potential targetnear $1.35.
However, XRP could decrease all the way to $0.70 (middle of the channel), and this would still be considered a valid formation.
BAND had been following a descending resistance line since Feb. 12, when it reached an all-time high price of $20.62.
It managed to break out on March 31 and reclaimed the $15.70 resistance area afterward. Currently, it is in the process of re-testing it as support.
The ensuing upward movement is expected to take it at least to $27.
After breaking out on March 28, ICX reached a high of $3.20 on March 31. Afterward, it returned to validate the $2.30 area as support.
After that, the token managed to break out from a descending resistance line. Therefore, it is expected to increase towards the $3.20 high and potentiallygo as far as $4.30.
On Feb. 19, IOTA reached a high of $1.70. Since then, it has been gradually moving upwards.
The movement since looks like a completedrunning flat.

2021-04-08 13:29:48+00:00,Bitcoin Stuck: Solution? Stay Out.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-stuck-solution-stay-132948545.html,FX Empire,"Patience. Most people don’t have it because they let their emotions run rampant. It is not surprising when you have droves of self appointed authorities and other fake gurus amplifying this fear of missing out, or over dramatizing a minor random pullback likeBitcoinis showing now.
Identifying quality opportunities begins with a set of very well defined rules. That does not mean they have to be complex rules, they just have to be adhered to. For example, one of our rules that is part of our long only swing trade strategy is to buy only at supprots upon confirmation within the context of a broader bullish trend. Since we don’t short Bitcoin, we don’t have to worry about that side of the equation, even within a persistent bearish environment (it doesn’t cost anything to stay out).
So where is support right now? On the time frame that we utilize, it is between 52,500 and 49,500. That is a pretty wide range, but based on the recent proportions and price structure, that is where support is defined. Price is no where near this area which means our rules clearly say: stay out.
Probability favors buying activity in the low 50K area and that can further be confirmed by price action. Instead of predicting moves, we let the market show its hand in areas where we anticipate a particular kind of activity. If Bitcoin can’t produce a compelling setup in an area of interest, all we have to do is stay out and wait. No stress, no fear of missing out, just following the rules.
Do we miss trades sometimes as a result of waiting for rules and confirmations to align? Sure, but we don’t lose any money from missing a move. These words may be easy to understand, but putting them into practice means going against your own bad habits and emotional baggage.
Improving your performance begins with developing your capacity for patience, not more and more information. High quality opportunities, especially on a swing trade time frame are INFREQUENT. If you are putting on more than 1 or 2 trades per WEEK, then you are not swing trading because that frequency is just not realistic in this slow environment.
As long as the trend stays bullish, we will be evaluating supports. IF price breaks below 48K, then we reevaluate the broader trend, not call for a bear market like so many will in such a scenario.

His net worth isreportedly$1.9 billion as of February 2021.
The 44-year-old CEO of Binance, the largest crypto exchange in the world, statedin a recent interviewthat he does not own any fiat holdings. And that his cryptocurrency investments will not be used to buy fiat holdings or for converting to cash in the future.
Also, as per atweetback in February, CZ said that he would only convert his cryptocurrency to fiat holdings when absolutely necessary.
Furthermore, he said he values liquidity above all else. It is for this reason that the businessman chooses not to own a car or a house. He said he preferred renting an apartment or getting a hotel instead due to the higher liquidity. In the interview, Zhao revealed that it is still feasible to realize his plan to make Binance a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).
It would be fair to say that Zhao has come a long way from where he started. He took a long time to build his crypto portfolio, at a time when he admits his net worth was in his Shanghai apartment. He later sold this apartment to buy Bitcoin.
Zhao was listed as one of thebillionaireson the Forbes billionaires list. Others listed with him include Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, Ripple Labs co-founder Chris Larsen, and the Gemini exchange founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.
The CEO stated that pushing the Binance Card will be a priority. A means by which merchants and traders can accept cryptocurrency transactions. And also a means for direct peer-to-peer transactions to take place.

2021-04-08 14:32:20+00:00,Social Crypto-trading Goes Live: Interview With A Top Trader From Decoin,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/social-crypto-trading-goes-live-143220866.html,Benzinga,"Anticipating another Bitcoin price spike, the crypto network continues to expand exponentially. After the briefdownturncaused by theIranian crackdown on crypto exchanges,Bitcoin quickly regained its position and now trades at a value slightly lower than its all-time high of $61,000. There’s no doubt that the market has grown exponentially since last year—in March 2020, the asset was trading at just $5k, A fact that seems unbelievable now considering its current price tag of $58,000. Even though the asset will perhaps never go back to the point from where it all began, every top-notch trader is more eager than ever to put their hard-earned money into Bitcoin with the hope that their returns will similarly skyrocket.
There indeed are a couple of reasons to be optimistic about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading. The digital payment giant, Visa, has made it clear that the USD Coin can now be used within its payment scope. This increases the odds that Bitcoin will be used as a means of payment at some point in the future. Many celebrities see the potential of Bitcoin—Elon Musk, 50 Cent, Snoop Dogg, and Gwyneth Paltrow are only some of the people who have enthusiastically joined this growing global investment movement. And even though cryptocurrency is still a highly volatile asset, it provides unparalleled arbitrage opportunities due to the absence of a centralized regulatory authority setting definitive price points.
Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for cryptocurrency-fuelled products has increased to a degree never seen before. With travel time to and from the office having become a thing of the past, on-screen time has faced unparalleled growth. This is one reason whyDecoindecided to create an innovative social trading platform that allows traders to openly interact and cultivate their best strategic approach within their community of like-minded individuals. Using its novel feature of performance-based evaluation, participants are able to easily identify the most successful traders and decide whose footsteps it makes sense to follow.
I recently spoke to Crypto Bull, one of Decoin’s top traders, and took advantage of the opportunity to ask him for his insights on the functionality of the platform and suggestions on the optimal trading strategy that would benefit anyone starting their cryptocurrency journey.
Hi, thanks for joining me for a talk. Let us begin by discussing the state of crypto-trading at the present moment. As a top trader, how would you evaluate the pace of the industry’s development, and what can we anticipate from the year 2021?
I am very satisfied with the growth of the industry. The cryptocurrency market cap just reached 2 trillion dollars, which is huge. The predictions anticipate that the market will reach 4 trillion dollars by the end of this year!
Is there anything we can add specifically about Bitcoin? Which factor plays the most significant part in the institutional adoption of this digital asset, and how far do you think its price rally will hold up?
I think that the new trend of using alternative energy to mine Bitcoin will help institutional adoption. The fact that financial institutions are joining the crypto revolution will possibly make the price skyrocket even more. I truly believe that big gains are awaiting the holders.
When thinking about cryptocurrency trading, what are the techniques that first come to your mind? As an experienced trader, which strategy do you see as a more secure bet—short-term trading or long-term holding?
The number one rule that guides my trading is ‘never go against the trend’.
Short-term trading is a better approach for uncertain periods, and holding works better during bearish times.
As a professional trader, which traits do you consider essential for excelling in this field? How do you manage to stay agile and flexible in the current market environment and not give up in case of a misfortune?
Never stay in the same spot. Always stay up to date on recent trends and hypes. I take part in active Telegram/Discord groups such as the Decoin channel to keep a finger on the pulse of the market.
Loss is part of the game. The most important thing is knowing you made the right decision.
What has been the biggest success story in your career to date? Could you share the secret of the most successful trades you have made?
I spotted the DeFi trend very early and made some very successful trades within a short period of time. I made the biggest profit when buying Uniswap and AAVE.
On the flip side, we are also interested in hearing about your “rainy days”. What was your biggest fiasco, and what lessons has it taught you? What helps you stay on the path of constant self-improvement?
At the beginning of 2019, I sold most of my Etherum at around $120. I didn’t sell it at the stop price that I had decided when I bought it, that was about $300.
It taught me to be always disciplined and stick to the original plan, even when there are big losses. This discipline will ensure that you make the biggest gains in the future.
What are the strategies one can implement when one is new to the cryptocurrency market? What are the risks associated with this activity, especially for freshers, and what’s the best way to avoid them?
My advice is to learn from those who have had the most proven profitable results throughout the years.
In Decoin, freshers can watch recorded sessions of traders and copy these top traders’ actions. I think this combination can be beneficial to new traders till they gain confidence.
Some cryptocurrency-backed assets are getting spots on the largest stock exchanges worldwide. Talking generally, where would you recommend people invest—on the stock market or a cryptocurrency exchange?
Revolutions are always the best choice, in my opinion. The whole cryptocurrency market is relatively new compared to the traditional market, and the potential is huge. I would pick the cryptocurrency market, so this is my advice to those asking for it.

2021-04-08 14:34:39+00:00,"Interview With Katherine Deng, Vice President Of MXC Exchange",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/interview-katherine-deng-vice-president-143439282.html,Benzinga,"Bitcoin recently suffered a significant price hiccup as over $6 billion worth of options contracts expiration date was approaching. However, the price has performed far better than expected even as the expiration date came. The coin’s recovery has already started, and many assume it is due to institutional involvement. Some predictions say that Bitcoin might even start seeinggovernment investmentsfairly soon, which will boost adoption stronger than ever before.
With millions upon millions of users already joining the industry due to surging prices, and more to be expected in weeks and months to come, it is more important than ever for investors around the world to have access to some of the best and most user-friendly exchanges that will be able to welcome these new users and help them find their way around in the growing crypto industry, such as MXC exchange.
MXCis a cryptocurrency exchange that was established during the crypto winter of 2018. However, the exchange started attracting a lot of interest recently, and its developers are all experts from financial firms and world-class enterprises. As such, they are highly experienced in blockchain and digital currencies.
As mentioned, the exchange has been attracting major interest lately, and it is licensed in 5 different countries — Seychelles, Switzerland, Australia, the US, and Canada. It has a rich selection of coins — over 370 of them — and more than twice the amount of trading pairs (over 750). Its daily trading volume is at around $4 billion, and as such, it managed to secure a place among the top 80 best and biggest exchanges on CoinMarketCap. Recently, it also announced apartnership with Solana Foundation and OKEX, to launch two new investment funds that would support the Solana ecosystem.
The crypto industry has experienced quite a difficult period recently. How did that reflect on MXC? （Might want to rephrase the question, as I doubt it can be considered as a “difficult period recently?” The answer below is fine though）
As always when there is strong volatility to be seen, there are those that are rapidly trying to sell, and those willing to buy the dip. This was no different. In fact, the price drop was rather mild, considering the worth of the expiring options, and the recovery started immediately after, when investors saw that there will be no great oversale.
This is largely thanks to institutional traders who rushed in to use the opportunity and buy the dip, so you could say that their strategy helped Bitcoin and the rest of the market find a foothold so quickly.
How many users do you have at the moment?
Currently, we have around5 million users in more than 70 countriesaround the world. We are really proud of this milestone, but we definitely aim to become a go-to platform for new and experienced investors as we move forward.
What is the biggest selling point of MXC? What drives people towards your platform?
There are many things that attract users to our platforms. We have compliance licenses in five different countries, so our users know that it is safe to use our platform. We offer over 750 trading pairs at the moment, with a trading volume exceeding $4 billion. In addition to that, we offer spot and margin trading, leveraged ETFs, derivatives trading, and staking services.
Our team members have rich experience in blockchain and financial industries, hailing from world-class companies. There are plenty of options on the platform, and everything is being done in a safe and secure environment, which is what most people need in order to feel comfortable enough to trade. They know that they can trust us with their money, and we have never done anything to bring that trust into question.
Recently, you managed to secure a spot among the top 80 on CoinMarketCap. It is a big achievement with such fierce competition. How did you do it?
The industry is quite competitive, and it is pretty much impossible to break through without a plan. What we achieved — gaining user trust, licenses, listing various products, and more — all came through the hard work of our developers and team members.
We always try to be as transparent as possible with our customers, and set goals that are both, optimistic and realistic at the same time. The quality of service is our top priority, and as long as we can guarantee it, we are willing to experiment and bring new services, features, products, and alike. We have gotten far with this mindset, but we don't plan to stop here.
What products does the exchange offer?
MXC offers a more than 750 crypto trading pair available for spot or margin trading. We have ETFs that can be traded with leverage, offering standard, professional, and index trading versions. Then, there are derivatives contracts, and PoS pools.
Most of these come in standard and professional versions, so that we can satisfy the needs and capabilities of novice traders and professionals alike. Everyone is welcome at MXC, and they can easily find what they need in a way that they can understand it.
Which are the most popular pairs on the platform?
Most of the time, it is BTC/USDT pair, which often sees volume beyond $40 million. After that, our native MX Token paired against USDT usually holds second place, followed by the likes of Ethereum Conflux Network, Dora Factory, Ramp, and many others, typically paired against USDT. There are some high-ranking non-USDT pairs, such as MX/ETH or ETH/BTC, but USDT pairs typically hold the majority of the top 10 list when it comes to volume.
Recently, MXC announced the partnership with OKEX and Solana Foundation. Can you tell us more about it?
We joined hands with Solana and OKEx to launch two investment funds that will bring another $40 million of new capital to Solana's ecosystem. The plan is to use this capital to accelerate the development and growth of some of Solana's key projects. Our team will provide support for Solana-based dApps and projects and help them ensure their future success and survival.
Our goal has always been to foster close collaboration with some of the most promising blockchain ecosystems, and Solana's potential definitely puts it high on the list of projects we are interested in supporting. After all, Solana saw over 50 market-ready projects launched in the last month alone, which opens up plenty of new opportunities, and we wish to be there to ensure that these and future projects will get everything they could ever need to thrive.
How will MXC help the Solana ecosystem grow?
Our primary purpose in this partnership will be to provide support, new capital, and help speed up the growth and development of the best projects emerging in Solana's ecosystem. Starting a new project and taking off is difficult under the best conditions, let alone in a highly-competitive and extremely volatile industry such as crypto.
We have seen many projects with potential fail just because they lacked the resources or they launched at the wrong time. By selecting the key projects, we will not only help the crypto industry advance and bring new use cases, but also Solana's ecosystem itself, which will become that much richer and more prosperous with every strong, competent project that finds its foothold as soon as possible, and starts to grow.
When you have a good project, all you need are the right conditions, and success is all but guaranteed. Solana has good projects, and we are coming to provide the conditions.
What can you tell us about the new investment funds that you plan to launch?
There will be two of them — two strategic investment funds, that will bring a total of US$40 million of new capital. ( Just 20 million investment fund excluding Okex’s) These will essentially be our contribution that will fuel the growth and expansion of the projects — go-to-market resources for protocol and dApp development.
How will MXC benefit from the partnership?
The investment sets forward our belief and commitment to shepherding the success of the dApps and platforms built on Solana. Solana will be the first step for high-quality blockchain projects that could help revolutionize not only the crypto industry, but all other industries that they may be focusing on.
Working strategically with the Solana team ties in naturally with our own vision and market position. We don't need more than that to make the right move. Simply put, by helping Solana, we are helping its projects, and through them — the future of financial and other industries that these projects aim to touch and improve.

Mark Cuban, after all, is rich and famous. He owns a jet and a basketball team. He’s a reality TV star who millions tune in to watch on “Shark Tank.” If you don’t listen to a guy who created one of the world’s greatest fortunes out of nothing, who do you listen to? Read: ‘Shark Tank’ Stars Share 50 Business Tips It wasn’t always that way. Cuban famously lived for years on the budget of a broke college student, driving lousy cars, eating lousy food and saving, saving, saving. A serial entrepreneur, forward-thinking investor and notorious taker of calculated risks, Cuban’s seed money is now fueling startups all over the country in all kinds of industries. The following is a selection of the finest Mark Cubanisms — from years past to just this year — that can inspire, educate and entertain investors of all levels . Last updated: April 8, 2021 Woman in her 30s filling out tax information online. Pay Off Debt, Then Invest In a 2018 interview with MarketWatch, Cuban laid down some indisputable arithmetic that explains why paying off debt before you invest might just deliver the biggest returns of all. “The best investment you can make is paying off your credit cards, paying off whatever debt you have. If you have a student loan with a 7% interest rate, if you pay off that loan, you’re making 7%, that’s your immediate return, which is a lot safer than picking a stock, or trying to pick real estate, or whatever it may be,” Cuban said.

Never Invest To Get Out of Trouble Just like you should never gamble if you absolutely have to win, Cuban insists that the same rules apply to investing as a remedy for financial trouble. “If you are buying because you need the price to go up and solve a financial hole you are in, that is the EXACT WRONG time to trade,” Cuban tweeted on Feb. 3. “And we all have to respect people who choose to sell because they need to. Bills don’t care what the market does [sic].

In 2007, he used his blog to offer some advice to young people who aren’t sure what to do with their money. He wrote: “Put it in the bank. The idiots that tell you to put your money in the market because eventually it will go up need to tell you that because they are trying to sell you something. The stock market is probably the worst investment vehicle out there. If you won’t put your money in the bank, NEVER put your money in something where you don’t have an information advantage.

Fine, but Cuban at least wants them to avoid picking their own stocks or buying into expensive mutual funds. His advice mirrors that which fellow billionaire investor Warren Buffett has long offered, as well — buy an index fund. In an interview with Hayman Capital Management founder Kyle Bass, Cuban said, “for those investors not too knowledgeable about markets, the best bet is a cheap S&P 500 fund,” according to MarketWatch.

But you would have to have the discipline of saving and how you spent your money once you got there.

Buy a Stock You Believe In and Hold on for Dear Life When the Reddit and GameStop trading frenzy went down, Cuban was able to offer some insightful advice as most of the investing world was struggling just to understand what was even going on. On a Reddit AMA (Ask Me Anything), Cuban responded to a Redditor’s call for advice with this comparison to Bitcoin.“Many bought at the highs in 2017 and watched it fall by ⅔ or more. But they held on because they believe in the asset … When I buy a stock, I make sure I know why I[‘m] buying it.

If You Don’t Understand an Investment, Walk Away Cuban has crossed philosophical paths with Warren Buffett more than once when it comes to investing fundamentals. Like Buffett, Cuban warns against investing in things you don’t understand. In 2010, Cuban wrote on his blog, “If you don’t fully understand the risks of an investment you are contemplating, it’s okay to do nothing.” More recently, he confirmed that position by stating even more emphatically, “No. 1 rule of investing: When you don’t know what to do, do nothing.” See: 21 Billionaires Who Lost Big in 2020 Focused young african businessman wear headphones study online watching webinar podcast on laptop listening learning education course conference calling make notes sit at work desk, elearning concept.

In 2007, he wrote: “At MicroSolutions it gave me a huge advantage.

Constellation Brands Shares Move Lower As Earnings Outlook Disappoints Shares of Constellation Brands found themselves under pressure after the company released its quarterly results and provided outlook for fiscal year 2022. The owner of Corona beer brand reported revenue of $1.95 billion and GAAP earnings of $1.95 per share, beating analyst estimates on both earnings and revenue. The company declared quarterly dividend of $0.76 per share, an increase from the previous dividend of $0.75 per share. At current stock price levels, Constellation Brands yields 1.37%, so its dividend is not sufficient enough to attract yield-oriented investors. In the fiscal year 2022, the company expects to report earnings of $6.90 – $7.20 per share compared to $10.23 per share in 2021 due to the negative impact of Canopy equity losses. On a comparable basis, earnings are projected to decline from $10.44 in 2021 to $9.97 in 2022. Analysts expected that Constellation Brands would report earnings of $10.44 in 2022, so the company’s earnings guidance was below expectations, which served as a material bearish catalyst for the stock in today’s trading session. What’s Next For Constellation Brands? The company’s decision to increase the dividend failed to provide any support to the stock as the market focused on weaker outlook for fiscal 2022. Constellation Brands did well during the challenging 2020, and its shares have fully recovered after the major sell-off in March 2020. However, it looks that the stock will need additional catalysts to gain more upside momentum and get back to recent highs. Assuming that Constellation Brands meets its adjusted earnings guidance for 2022, the stock is trading at 22 forward P/E. This is a reasonable valuation in today’s market, but it’s certainly not cheap enough to count as a value play. Meanwhile, the lack of earnings growth may put some pressure on the company’s shares. At the same time, it remains to be seen whether the company’s guidance is too conservative and actual results will be better.

The U.S. Dollar Index managed to settle below the support at the 20 EMA at 92.35 and is currently trying to settle below the next support at 92.15. A successful test of this level will push the U.S. Dollar Index towards the 92 level which will be bearish for USD/CAD.

The world’s leading food company said its net sales surged more than 8% to $2.77 billion during the three months ended on February 28, 2021. That was above the market expectations of $2.72 billion. Adjusted earnings per share came in at 0.59, beating analysts’ consensus estimates of 0.58 per share.
Net sales for the grocery & snacks segment increased 10.8% to $1.1 billion in the quarter reflecting: a 2.3% decrease from the impact of the Sold Businesses; and a 13.1% increase in organic net sales. On an organic net sales basis, volume increased 9.4% and price/mix increased 3.7%. Volume benefited from continued elevated at-home food consumption as a result of theCOVID-19 pandemic.
Conagra Brandsforecasts organic adjusted operating margin in the range of 14% to 15% and adjusted EPS between $0.49 to $0.55 in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2021. For fiscal 2022, the company expects net sales growth (3-year CAGR ending fiscal 2022) of +1% to +2%, an adjusted operating margin of 18% to 19%, and adjusted EPS of $2.63 to $2.73.
Conagra Brands’shares, which about 6% in 2020, traded nearly flat at $37.19 on Thursday.
“We remain confident that each of our retail domains – frozen, snacks, and staples – is well-positioned to sustain the benefits of the eat-at-home habits consumers have developed during theCOVID-19 pandemic. Our continued business momentum, coupled with our disciplined approach to investment, reinforce our confidence in the long-term potential of the business and our ability to create sustained value for our shareholders,” said Sean Connolly, president and chief executive officer of Conagra Brands.
“We further demonstrated this confidence by repurchasing nearly $300 million of our common stock this quarter, which came after we raised our quarterly dividend 29% earlier this fiscal year.”
“Conagra Brands (CAG)Q3 EPS of $0.59, slightly ahead of cons. $0.58, driven by below-the-line items. Org. sales growth beat (+9.7% vs. +7.3%), although gross and op. margins missed, albeit at the low end of mgmt’s Q3 guide. FY’22 guidance reaffirmed with 8.8mm shares repo’d in Q3, which could add $0.05 to FY’22 EPS. Q4 guide above cons. sales, but below on implied op. profit at margin guide midpoint, driven by cost inflation. The question now on margin progression in FY’22,” noted Rob Dickerson, equity analyst at Jefferies.
Three analysts who offered stock ratings forConagra Brandsin the last three months forecast the average price in 12 months of $37.00 with a high forecast of $40.00 and a low forecast of $34.00.
The average price target represents a -0.40% decrease from the last price of $37.15. Of those three analysts, one rated “Buy”, one rated “Hold” and one rated “Sell”, according to Tipranks.
Morgan Stanley gave the base target price of $38 with a high of $48 under a bull scenario and $25 under the worst-case scenario. The firm gave an “Equal-weight” rating on the packaged foods company’s stock.
“Advantaged legacyConagra Brands (CAG)topline growth outlook: Exposure to frozen, an opportunity to turnaround refrigerated business, and snacking growth should sustain LSD org sales growth. PF deal increases operational complexity and reduces fundamental visibility: Greater risk of PF disappointing given higher expectations from management’s strong turnaround track record,” noted Pamela Kaufman, equity analyst at Morgan Stanley.
“We see solid topline growth but limited potential for mid-term target upside: Opportunity to close gross margin gap vs peers, but see downside risk if topline/synergy estimates fall short of optimistic F22 targets. The valuation reflects higher leverage: 10.5x 2022 EV/EBITDA valuation reflects relatively higher leverage of 3.6x net debt/EBITDA.”
Several other analysts have also updated their stock outlook.Conagra Brandshad its price target boosted by Credit Suisse Group to $34 from $33. They currently have an underperform rating on the stock. Zacks Investment Research upgraded Conagra Brands to a hold rating from a sell rating and set a $36 price objective. Jefferies Financial Group issued a buy rating and a $41 price objective for the company.

To Peter Thiel, it might be. Here’s what the tech entrepreneur said yesterday at an event hosted by the Richard Nixon Foundation (asreportedby CoinDesk’s Colin Harper).
“Even though I’m a pro-crypto, pro-bitcoin maximalist person, I do wonder whether if, at this point, bitcoin should also be thought of in part as a Chinese financial weapon against the U.S. … It threatens fiat money, but it especially threatens the dollar.”

This makes perfect sense, and no sense, simultaneously.
In the no-sense category: China doesn’t control bitcoin and would find it hard to do so, because, you know, decentralization. Although something likethree-quartersof the world’s mining is in China, and theoretically Beijing could take that over, other miners could easily set up elsewhere. Bitcoin is adaptable and, so far, has remained impervious to government intervention.
If China, somehow, did manage to control bitcoin, that would probably limit its impact as a global currency anyway. As Ripple’s Brad Garlinghousesaid in 2018: “How do we know that China won’t intervene [in controlling bitcoin]? How many countries want to use a Chinese-controlled currency? It’s just not going to happen.”
Related:Money Reimagined - Saturday, April 10, 2021
But Thiel is right in a less literal sense.
Bitcoin doesn’t look like it’s replacing the dollar as a global reserve currency anytime soon. It’s becoming too valuable as a store of value to be a means of exchange. The asset has millions of holders but, as yet, few spenders.
But it has opened the door on monetary technology, with big geopolitical consequences. Because of bitcoin, we think differently about how to transfer value. Growing numbers of people understand that you don’t need a bank or middleman to do that.
China is adapting this insight to its very state-oriented view of the world. Its plans for a digital yuan allied to an internationalblockchain services networkcould obviate the need for companies and individuals to use any form of reserve currency and allow trade to go around theU.S. banking system.
Going forward, we’re likely to hear a lot more comments like Thiel’s, even if they’re a bit confused. (There’s something strange about a bitcoiner worrying about U.S. state power, but nevermind.) China is a convenient foil, as we saw in 2019 when Facebook’s David Marcus conjured up the specter of Chinese monetary innovation to make the case for libra (since renamed and reconfigured as diem).
“The future in five years, if we don’t have a good answer, is basically China re-wiring [the world] with a digital renminbi running on their controlled blockchain,” Marcus told the U.S. Congress. The U.S. could lose the right to make sanctions on other countries and could find itself on the wrong end of them, too, he said.
As China rolls out its blockchain weapons, differences in monetary approach will become starker – privacy versus surveillance, state-run versus private enterprise,“clean” bitcoin versus “dirty”bitcoin – and we’ll see new forms of conflict between long-time rivals. The rest of us will have to choose which side we’re on.

Illiquid markets, after all, are the scourge of DeFi traders, leaving them susceptible to slippage and thus reduced profits.
While low liquidity can blight even the most popular DeFi trading pairs, it is particularly pronounced with low cap cryptos: tokens whose minor market capitalization means shallow pools where slippage is all but inevitable. Fine if you’re swapping $100 of tokens, but if you’re a whale, it’s impossible to take up a position without moving the market.
XFaiis a new project that’s focused on solving the problem of illiquid DEX pools, specifically those of low cap tokens that have traditionally struggled to achieve optimum liquidity levels. XFai defines small cap tokens as being any asset whose market capitalization is below $400 million – which currently applies to all but the top 170 crypto assets. Most of DeFi, in other words.
XFai is advancing a system for rewarding LPs of low cap tokens, thereby making it profitable to hold these assets and to provide liquidity for them. The solution XFai proposes entails a proprietary technology known as DLO: DEX Liquidity Oracle.
The Downlow on the DLO
Oracles provide pricing information on DeFi assets, including that derived from external sources such as alternative blockchains and from traditional markets. They are a critical part of decentralized finance, supporting the trading of synths and non-native assets e.g. BTC on Ethereum. The DLO that XFai has devised can be thought of as an oracle on steroids: all the capabilities of an ordinary pricing oracle but with superpowers.
In addition to providing price feeds and triggering third party contracts, XFai’s DLO will actively manage token liquidity on DEXs such as Uniswap. The idea is that holders of small cap tokens can lock these into the XFai smart contract, which in turn deploys them on Uniswap in a manner that will optimize price-to-order matching. Large trades will be prioritized, directing deeper liquidity to those who need it most.
In return for providing liquidity to small cap tokens, lenders can earn rewards. What’s more, they only need to supply single-sided liquidity i.e. pooling one asset, thereby reducing impermanent loss. XFai’s proprietary oracle will read APIs across multiple order books from centralized exchanges. Then, using a synthetic curve, the DLO focuses the order book volume on where the price action is being conducted.
There’s a lot more to XFai’s DEX Liquidity Oracle but it boils down to this: by obtaining more up-to-date pricing information from CEXs than other oracles, it can direct liquidity towhereit’s needed on Uniswap,whenit’s needed. The result is deeper liquidity and less slippage.
What Makes XFai Different
One of the drawbacks to many emerging DeFi projects is that their proposed solution entails migrating users – and thus liquidity – to their own native platform. This results in fragmentation, further reducing liquidity across the DeFi landscape. Moreover, the introduction of additional platforms and protocols, while potentially advantageous from a tech perspective, adds further layers of complexity, and serves to scatter DeFi users.
What makesXFaidifferent is that it’s designed to workwithrather than competeagainstexisting DEXs. It can be applied to AMMs such as Uniswap and used to optimize their liquidity rather than further eroding it. As such, there is reason to believe that XFai’s DLO solution – if proven effective – will be integrated into DEXs, where it will work to deliver a better deal for all: LPs, traders, and low cap projects, whose token will be able to enjoy liquidity once synonymous with big caps.

2021-04-08 17:00:00+00:00,Kava Announces It Enables Institutional Bitcoin Holders to Get over 45% APR,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kava-announces-enables-institutional-bitcoin-170000406.html,ACCESSWIRE,"SAN FRANCISCO, CA / ACCESSWIRE / April 8, 2021 /Kava announces today that it enables institutions to earn +45% APR on Bitcoin holdings without counterparty risk. The Kava base-layer infrastructure has been optimized. Kava Labs released the Kava 5 upgrade to the public including its borrow-side functionality.
In Brief
1. Kava brings a 45% APR to institutional Bitcoin holders
2. This high APR has no counterparty risk
3. Institutional-level DeFi is now widely accessible
Bitcoin and others have enabled users to take control of funds removing the need for banks and middlemen. Now users can custody their digital assets, store value, and make payments without the fees.
However, with great power comes great responsibility. The old centralized way is being a recipient - you get your checking and savings accounts, but you can't custody your assets.
Institutional investors have been paying increasing attention to Bitcoin in recent months. The growing number of publicly traded companies having a Bitcoin treasury is just one such indicator. Kava's recent protocol upgrade lets these companies take out loans on their assets.
Institutional Investors Flock To Bitcoin
The past twelve months have been intriguing as far as Bitcoin is concerned. Besides the price hype, the big news is how more institutional investors seek exposure to the world's leading cryptocurrency. Rather than spending money on futures contracts, these companies purchase Bitcoin as part of theirTreasury. Several companies have been outspoken about these purchases, including MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Meitu.
To some, this approach may seem risky. Bitcoin remains a volatile asset that can undergo wild price fluctuations. However, every company creating a Bitcoin Treasury over the past few months is currently in profit. Though uncertain, this approach is working out for Bitcoin holders.
Now that these institutional players are invested in Bitcoin, one has to wonder what comes next. Will they sell when the price is at the next all-time high, or keep adding more BTC to their Treasury? Figuring out this ""retention"" angle will prove necessary if this industry is to keep on growing globally. The market is looking for a strategy to ""HODL"" harder and money markets are one solution for these institutions.
Institutional-Grade Borrowing
Sophisticated institutions are using their current Bitcoin holdings as collateral for loans. As part of theKava5upgrade, the HARD Protocol received an update to Version 2 fully competing the whitepaper of the project. This upgrade provides borrowing with variable interest rates and HARD token distribution to suppliers and borrowers alike.
Assuming companies like Tesla want to put their BTC to work, they can do so through the Kava lending app and the HARD Protocol app. Any financial institution can earn 45% on their current BTC holdings without counterparty risk. As Tesla owns $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin - or an estimated 48,000 BTC - they can earn up to 21,600 BTC with a 12 month lock-up period. Kava provides a significant passive income stream that institutions can explore by turning their Bitcoin into a cash-flowing asset.
The option of lending and borrowing is an increasingly popular aspect of decentralized finance. To date, Bitcoin's role in DeFi remains minimal, as few protocols support the world's leading currency in its native form. More often than not, users need to convert their holdings to a tokenized or wrapped version and spend money to do so. Protocols that support Bitcoin natively can benefit from the growing interest in cryptocurrencies by institutional investors.
Convincing the institutions that hold Bitcoin to explore DeFi options will be a tall order. Although a 45% return with no counterparty risk is appealing, it remains unclear how many companies prefer this option because the risk with DeFi is there's no counterparty to sue when things go wrong.
Closing Thoughts
As more Bitcoin-oriented DeFi solutions come to market, the landscape will grow more competitive and compelling. Catering to institutional-grade players is the next order of business, as big money is pouring into Bitcoin.
Keeping that momentum going will require compelling options, either through decentralized finance or otherwise. The coming months may prove crucial in this regard, as these institutional players may not sit around for too long.
""As more enterprises and financial institutions adopt bitcoin and crypto currencies, the more valuable the Kava DeFi platform will become as it enables this new wave of financially minded users with a way to finally put their assets to work and make Bitcoin and other crypto into a cash flowing asset on their balance sheets."" - Brian Kerr, CEO of Kava Labs

The value of bitcoin or any other cryptocurrencies can fluctuate dramatically at the drop of a hat. Sometimes there’s an explanation and big swings in the crypto market are tied to news or some other sort of development. Other times, however, there’s really no rhyme or reason at all. Of course, the second rule of cryptocurrency is at least as important as the first rule. As a matter of fact, it might be even more important: Nothing is safe if you store it online. It doesn’t matter whether you hold your crypto at a top exchange like Coinbase and Binance or you’ve packed away your coins in a cloud-based wallet. In either case, you are exposed.

Kava Labs said Thursday the upgrade to its infrastructure, built on the Cosmos SDK, means there are a number of performance improvements for users, allowing them to borrow against multiple cryptocurrency assets and earn staking rewards.
The move comes at a time when DeFi is finding its legs on blockchains beyond its traditional home, Ethereum.

“This upgrade will finalize the transition of Kava as a single application blockchain to an industry-leading DeFi platform complete with interoperable cross-chain tooling, secure price feeds and enterprise-grade reliability that financial institutions can trust,” Kava Labs CEO Brian Kerr told CoinDesk.
Additionally, Kerr told CoinDesk the upgrade will also complete the Hard protocol, the first cross-chain money market built on Kava’s platform that offers lending, borrowing and yield on cryptocurrencies such asbitcoin,XRPand BNB.
The upgrade is aimed squarely at institutional investors and corporate treasuries, according to documents shared with CoinDesk, touting the ability for firms to get 25% APY on their bitcoin without counterparty risk. While the risk of traditional players not fulfilling their lending obligations is obviated, it should be noted that smart-contract risk and other factors certainly remain in play.
“Convincing the institutions that hold Bitcoin to explore DeFi options will be a tall order,” Kava Labs admitted in a statement.

Bitcoin (BTC) has mostly been trading sideways, butcompared to last week, it has overall been bearish. Last week’s bull run saw BTC’s price jump from around $51,500 on March 26 to nearly $60,000 on March 31. However, on April 1, it began channeling between $58,000 and just below $60,000.
On April 3, the price fell to $57,000, which it struggled to overcome the next day before falling back to that level on April 5. Later that day, though, theprice bounced back up above $59,000. Persistent selling pressure then took it back down to $56,000 by April 7. Bitcoin is currently trading just below $58,000.
Despite this short-term volatility, bitcoin is still in an overall uptrend,according to Fairlead Strategiesanalyst Katie Stockton.
“In our reports, we’ve highlighted a short- and intermediate-term neutral view for both bitcoin and ethereum (ETH), within the context of their long-term trends,” she said. “So, if we were a long-term holder we’d certainly sit with these coins.”
Goldhad a rollercoaster ridelast week, which ended on an upswing. That trend continued this week.
On April 1, gold continued trading up before rising to $1,730 by the end of the day. It reached nearly $1,735, where it stalled going into the weekend. Gold channeled mostly between $1,730 and $1,720 when markets reopened on April 5.
Meanwhile, April 6 began with buying pressure that largely continued into the afternoon, rising to $1,745. Gold floated down to $1,735 by the end of April 7. But buying pressure early in the day pushed gold’s price up to $1,755, where it is currently trading.
This is the highest gold has been trading for over a month, as the dollar and U.S. yields dropped and the Federal Reserve’s reaffirmation of its dovish policy stance also lifted its appeal.
Bob Haberkorn, senior market strategist, RJO Futures,said:
“The dollar and U.S. yields are coming off, and that’s the key catalyst right now. A pretty unimpressive jobs number is also helping push gold higher.”
Haberkorn further added:
“And the fact that we’re above $1,750, which is a key technical level, shows that gold has some legs to continue higher.”
The S&P 500 (SPX) reached a new all-time high last week, rising above the $4,000 threshold for the first time. This pushed on to $4,020 on April 1. On April 5, the price had gapped up even further, pushing past $4,080 by the end of the day.
It seemed to have met resistance at this point, trading at this level for the next two days. However, on April 8, it began trading up again, reaching $4,095, where it is currently trading.
One reason the S&P 500 eked out another record closing high was minutes from the Federal Reserve’s March meeting. The minutes mentioned policymakers’ commitment to accommodative monetary policy to support a full economic recovery while showing concerns about the job market’s recovery.
Mike Loewengart, managing director of investment strategy at E-Trade Financial,wrote:
“With the tick up in jobless claims this week, we’re back up to the elevated levels we saw to kick off the year.”
This week’s wildcard stock is Canopy Growth Corporation. Over the past few months, the stock of the Canadiancannabis company had traded largelylike a cryptocurrency.
After seeing increased momentum towards the end of last year, it exploded in the new year, reaching an all-time high by mid-February. However, like the crypto markets, it tumbled down towards the end of the month.
Although unassociated with cryptocurrencies, the marijuana industry is also arelative newcomer to financial markets.
Although the stock has struggled in the past month, some good news is on the horizon. The companyannouncedthis week that it would be acquiring Toronto-based Supreme Cannabis Co. Inc. in a stock and cash deal valued at about $345.6 million. As marijuana becomes increasingly legalized across States in America, this consolidation could CGC meet that exploding demand.
This week’s bonus stock in Airbnb (ABNB). ABNB had its IPO on Dec. 10, 2020. Despite occurring in the midst of a global pandemic, thehouse-sharing platform popular with touristshas fared well coming into the new year.
The stock saw healthy buying pressure in the first month of the year. This continued to its peak, once again in mid-February, of $219.88.

2021-04-08 19:50:12+00:00,Immersion cooling to offset data centers' massive power demands gains a big booster in Microsoft,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/immersion-cooling-offset-data-centers-195012165.html,TechCrunch,"LiquidStack does it.So does Submer. They're both dropping servers carrying sensitive data into goop in an effort to save the planet. Now they're joined by one of the biggest tech companies in the world in their efforts to improve the energy efficiency of data centers, because Microsoft is getting into the liquid-immersion cooling market.
Microsoft is using a liquid it developed in-house that's engineered to boil at 122 degrees Fahrenheit (lower than the boiling point of water) to act as a heat sink, reducing the temperature inside the servers so they can operate at full power without any risks from overheating.
The vapor from the boiling fluid is converted back into a liquid through contact with a cooled condenser in the lid of the tank that stores the servers.
“We are the first cloud provider that is running two-phase immersion cooling in a production environment,” said Husam Alissa, a principal hardware engineer on Microsoft’s team for datacenter advanced development in Redmond, Washington, in a statement on the company's internal blog.
While that claim may be true, liquid cooling is a well-known approach to dealing with moving heat around to keep systems working. Cars use liquid cooling to keep their motors humming as they head out on the highway.
As technology companies confront the physical limits of Moore's Law, the demand for faster, higher performance processors mean designing new architectures that can handle more power, the company wrote in a blog post. Power flowing through central processing units has increased from 150 watts to more than 300 watts per chip and the GPUs responsible for much of Bitcoin mining, artificial intelligence applications and high end graphics each consume more than 700 watts per chip.
It's worth noting that Microsoft isn't the first tech company to apply liquid cooling to data centers and the distinction that the company uses of being the first ""cloud provider"" is doing a lot of work. That's because bitcoin mining operations have been using the tech for years. Indeed, LiquidStack was spun out from a bitcoin miner to commercialize its liquid immersion cooling tech and bring it to the masses.
Spinning out from the cryptocurrency hardware developer Bitfury, LiquidStack pitches a data center cooling tech
""Air cooling is not enough""
More power flowing through the processors means hotter chips, which means the need for better cooling or the chips will malfunction.
“Air cooling is not enough,” said Christian Belady, vice president of Microsoft’s datacenter advanced development group in Redmond, in an interview for the company's internal blog. “That’s what’s driving us to immersion cooling, where we can directly boil off the surfaces of the chip.”
For Belady, the use of liquid cooling technology brings the density and compression of Moore's Law up to the datacenter level
The results, from an energy consumption perspective, are impressive. The company found that using two-phase immersion cooling reduced power consumption for a server by anywhere from 5 percent to 15 percent (every little bit helps).
Microsoft investigated liquid immersion as a cooling solution for high performance computing applications such as AI. Among other things, the investigation revealed that two-phase immersion cooling reduced power consumption for any given server by 5% to 15%.
Meanwhile, companies like Submer claim they reduce energy consumption by 50%, water use by 99%, and take up 85% less space.
Submer is dunking servers in goo to save the planet
For cloud computing companies, the ability to keep these servers up and running even during spikes in demand, when they'd consume even more power, adds flexibility and ensures uptime even when servers are overtaxed, according to Microsoft.
“[We] know that with Teams when you get to 1 o’clock or 2 o’clock, there is a huge spike because people are joining meetings at the same time,” Marcus Fontoura, a vice president on Microsoft's Azure team, said on the company's internal blog. “Immersion cooling gives us more flexibility to deal with these burst-y workloads.”
At this point, data centers are a critical component of the internet infrastructure that much of the world relies on for... well... pretty much every tech-enabled service. That reliance however has come at a significant environmental cost.
“Data centers power human advancement. Their role as a core infrastructure has become more apparent than ever and emerging technologies such as AI and IoT will continue to drive computing needs. However, the environmental footprint of the industry is growing at an alarming rate,” Alexander Danielsson, an investment manager at Norrsken VC noted last year when discussing that firm's investment in Submer.
If submerging servers in experimental liquids offers one potential solution to the problem -- then sinking them in the ocean is another way that companies are trying to cool data centers without expending too much power.
Microsoft has already been operating an undersea data center for the past two years. The company actually trotted out the tech as part of a push from the tech company to aid in the search for a COVID-19 vaccine last year.

These pre-packed, shipping container-sized data centers can be spun up on demand and run deep under the ocean’s surface for sustainable, high-efficiency and powerful compute operations, the company said.
The liquid cooling project shares most similarity withMicrosoft’s Project Natick, which is exploring the potential of underwater datacenters that are quick to deploy and can operate for years on the seabed sealed inside submarine-like tubes without any onsite maintenance by people.
In those data centers nitrogen air replaces an engineered fluid and the servers are cooled with fans and a heat exchanger that pumps seawater through a sealed tube.
Startups are also staking claims to cool data centers out on the ocean (the seaweed is always greener in somebody else's lake).
Nautilus Data Technologies, for instance, has raised over $100 million (according to Crunchbase) to develop data centers dotting the surface of Davey Jones' Locker. The companyis currently developing a data center projectco-located with a sustainable energy project in a tributary near Stockton, Calif.
With the double-immersion cooling tech Microsoft is hoping to bring the benefits of ocean-cooling tech onto the shore. “We brought the sea to the servers rather than put the datacenter under the sea,” Microsoft's Alissa said in a company statement.

2021-04-08 19:52:00+00:00,Elon Musk's Tesla Model 3 is the least expensive Tesla — but is it affordable?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/afford-tesla-even-youre-not-023000942.html,Moneywise,"Everything Elon Musk touches seems to turn to gold — including Tesla. The automotive company has taken the idea of an eco-friendly electric car and turned it into a lust-worthy luxury vehicle.
When the first Teslas hit the market with hefty price tags of $100,000 or more for a brand-new Model S or Model X, the cars were accessible only to those with deep pockets.
Much has changed since those early days. Today, you canbuy a Tesla with Bitcoin, and buyers can now choose a Model 3, which is considered an ""affordable"" Tesla.
But is it really? Here's what we found.
Teslas aren't sold through traditional dealerships with lots filled with cars. Though the company operates stores where you can see the vehicles up close and possibly take a test drive, buyers have to order their cars online. Delivery takes up to 12 weeks.
The most affordable Tesla is the Model 3, which entered the market in 2017 at a starting price of $35,000 but now starts at about $38,000. ""Delivery fees"" add $1,200 to the price, for a total of about $39,200.
You'll pay state sales tax on a new Tesla, too, unless you live in Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire or Oregon.
Not as cheap as you were hoping for? Start saving up now — maybe by using a popular app that helps you grow your moneyby investing ""spare change.""
The base price is for a white Tesla with standard wheels and an all-black interior. If you want a black, silver, blue or red Tesla, and you desire sport wheels or a black-and-white interior, you'll pay more.
When you place your Model 3 order, you'll pay a nonrefundable $100 order fee. That's much more reasonable than the $1,000 down payment that was required to reserve your spot in line when the Model 3 first debuted amid heavy demand.
Don't get the wrong idea: A down paymentwillbe required when you lease or finance a Tesla, but it's due at signing — not when you order your vehicle. The company will want you to put $4,500 down.
The Tesla website'sloan calculatorestimates that financing through the automaker would give you a monthly payment of $519 for 72 months (six years). A three-year lease would cost $371 a month.
The government has offered generous federal tax credits of up to $7,500 for buyers of electric vehicles, but a limited number of credits were available by manufacturer, and the Tesla credits have long been ""sold out."" Now, the Biden administration is reportedly considering raising the credit to $10,000, and ending the limits.
If you’re into crypto, you can now buy a Tesla using Bitcoin. Musk, the Tesla CEO — or rather, ""Technoking"" (his real title now) — made the announcement on Twitter a month after Tesla bought $1.5 billion worth of thecryptocurrency.
Buying with Bitcoin is an option currently offered only to U.S. customers, though Musk says the company will soon expand that to other countries.
Keep in mind that insurance for electric cars generally costs more than for conventional vehicles, so it's essential to shop around thoroughly tofind coverage at the best price.
When you buy a brand-new car, it typically loses 20% of its value in the first year. This is why in many cases it may be wiser to purchase a used car.
But the Tesla Model 3 doesn't follow the usual depreciation rules. Used cars sold through the company's website cost no less than a new Model 3; the main benefit of buying a used Tesla is that you won't be waiting up to three months for your vehicle.
Research by the automotive websiteiSeeCarsfound the Tesla Model 3 is the used car that's best at holding its value. The buyer of a used, 1-year-old car pays an average of just 2.1%, or $923, less than someone buying a new Model 3.
Tesla says the used cars it sells must pass a 145-point inspection and are covered by a limited used vehicle warranty, which adds another one year or 10,000 miles of coverage to whatever's left from the original warranty.
One option to buying used from Tesla is going online and using a major website witha broad inventory of used carsavailable for purchase, including Teslas. You can prequalify for financing and even get a Tesla delivered straight to your door, with a seven-day test-to-own period.
In the U.S., the average car has a fuel economy of 24.9 miles per gallon, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Let’s round that up to 25.
Federal Highway Administrationdatashows Americans drive different amounts at different ages in their lives; the age group that can afford a Tesla is probably driving around 15,000 miles per year, on average. There are multiple mile-tracking apps you can download on your phone if you need help tracking your own miles.
Let's assume that the current price of gasoline is $2.50 a gallon, a nice, round number. (Note: Using round numbers makes the math a heck of a lot easier to do and understand.)
So, let’s break it down: You're driving 15,000 miles in one year, and going 25 miles one one gallon of gas. That means you'll have to buy 600 gallons over the course of one year. (15,000 divided by 25 equals 600).
If you’re paying $2.50 for each gallon, that’s 600 times $2.50, which equals $1,500.00. Since there are 12 months in a year, you’re probably paying somewhere in the ballpark of $125 per month for gas.
So, what’s Tesla’s fuel economy? It’s the equivalent of a staggering 130 miles per gallon, the EPA says — even though the cars don't run on gasoline. But you will be paying for electricity, ""supercharging"" and a few other things.
The cheapest way to charge your Tesla (or any electric car) is to find a free charging station. If you’re not sure where to go, a number of apps are available that will show the charging stations closest to you.
As time goes on and electric cars become more common, you will probably see more of these stations popping up around your area. The only downside to using a free public charging station is that it can take a while for your battery to fill up. Expect to sit there for an houror more.
Tesla has its own “Supercharging Stations"" around the country that allow you to charge your battery in just 15 minutes. You do pay for the privilege; Tesla says pricing ""may vary by location, and prices may change from time to time.""
If you don’t have any charging stations in your local area, the only option will be to charge your car at home. Most people plug their electric cars into an outlet in their garage and just forget about them and go about their nightly business.
If you choose to charge your car this way, you'll want to plug it in at any time other than the ""peak time"" of the day, when electricity is most expensive. Peak hours and rates depend on where you live, so you’re going to want to ask your electric company what its policies are.
One of the potential issues to keep in mind when buying a Tesla is that the cars have not existed for very long. There aren't many experienced mechanics who know how to fix the cars’ unique features, like the wing doors and the complicated computer system.
This means if something serious goes wrong, your car may need to be shipped to a Tesla service center. Depending on where you live, that can be a long journey.
Prominent tech reviewer Marques Brownlee offers valuable in-depth analysis of each Tesla model on his YouTube channel. He explains that only a few thousand miles into owning the Tesla Model S, his car beganhaving very serious steering issuesthat could have caused an accident. The bright side was that car was still under warranty.
Tesla takes these issues very seriously and will give you a rental Tesla to drive while it takes care of the problems. Sometimes, a Tesla-certified mechanic will even drive to your house to help you, free of charge.
Remember that Tesla is still largely a luxury car; as with owning a BMW or Mercedes, parts can be expensive. New Teslas are covered under warranty for four years or 50,000 miles, whichever comes first.
If you never want to deal with the headache of paying for expensive repairs, you may want to consider selling it once the warranty is up.
The amount of money you'll save or spend by switching to a Tesla is going to vary, depending on your individual situation. You may not save money. You may pay more.
The Tesla Model 3 is far more affordable than the other Tesla models, including the Model S and Model X, which now start at around $80,000 and $90,000, respectively. So yes, you don't necessarily have to be rich to buy a $38,000 Model 3.
But if you're making a monthly payment of $519 for a new Tesla Model 3, that's $6,228 a year — and many other vehicles will cost you less.
If you're already paying in the ballpark of $600 per month for the vehicle you're currently driving and have your eye on a Model 3, then go for it.

Philip Gradwell, chief economist at Chainalysis, said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” show that “relatively little” ether (ETH) was bought at prices above $1,850 and even less was bought at $2,000 or above.
“The reason why this is important is because the price that people are willing to buy and hold at tells us the level of demand that there is at that price level,” Gradwell said. “So not a huge amount of demand at that $2,000 price.”

As of April 5, blockchain data showed there was significant ether accumulation at prices around $1,800, Gradwell wrote this week in a newsletter. That price level is likely to provide strong support because the cost of acquisition indicates historical demand for a cryptocurrency at different price levels. The analysis assumes that the buyers are unlikely to sell their crypto asset at prices below their cost of acquisition.
Only about 700,000 ETH were acquired at or above $1,850, costing around $1.4 billion on April 5, three days after ether logged a new all-time high price, Gradwell wrote. By contrast, on March 29 – two weeks after bitcoin’s price peaked – 238,000 BTC costing about $14 billion were acquired at or above $57,000.
The latest “all-time high [ether] price of $2,151 was some way above a large level of support, and suggests that the peak was driven by a relatively small amount of demand,” Gradwell wrote. “This is in contrast to bitcoin, which had greater prior demand across high price levels.”
The chart below, from Gradwell’s newsletter on April 1, also shows that 0.1 million bitcoin were acquired at prices higher than the spot price on March 29:

The exercise highlights the limits of using blockchain data to analyze market movements: While the data can offer extra transparency, helping investors and traders understand where cryptocurrency is moving on the networks, the data can also bemisleading, relying on humans for the interpretation as well as assumptions about investor psychology. .
Gradwell said on CoinDesk TV that his analysis included some potential “downward biases,” which could skew ether’s supporting price level on the lower end.
The analysis didn’t capture the prices of sales and trades made on centralized exchanges.
But Gradwell argued that with the increased shift of ether trading to decentralized finance (DeFi), which is trackable on the blockchain, he is “not worried about such downward bias.”
At the same time, Gradwell’s analysis also flattens the cost curve of entities that acquired ether at different prices, which may skew the supporting price level lower.
“Large entities, such as DeFi contracts, tend to hold lots of ETH acquired at both low and high costs,” he wrote in the newsletter. “For example, 7.4 million ETH with an average cost of acquisition of $1,818 is held in the wrapped ether contracts.”
On the upward bias side, CoinDesk’s Lawrence Lewitinn said on the CoinDesk TV show that Gradwell’s analysis is based on an assumption that people would not sell their ether at a loss. If ether holders are willing to sell their ether at a loss, it means that the $1,800 supporting level may be less strong than expected.
Gradwell said a majority of investors who bought ether at its peak price in 2018 sold their ether at a loss, while more bitcoin holders at the time continued to hold their bitcoin throughout the bear market.
“The persistence of a small, but very bullish, cohort of ether buyers supports my concern that the highest ether prices tend to have a narrow base of support, at least compared to bitcoin,” Gradwell wrote.

As interest in cryptocurrencies expands, there is an increase in energy consumption.
The energy consumption of the Bitcoin network made waves at the end of 2017.Even mainstream news outletswere reporting that it uses more electricity than the entire country of Ireland.
At the time, the network consumed an estimated consume over 30 terawatt-hours (TWh) a year. This is less than itscurrent consumption of 95.45 TWh, according to Digiconomist.
The index explains that the yearly impact of bitcoin is 45.34 metric tons (mt) of CO2. This is comparable to Hong Kong. The coin’s 10.97 kt of e-waste is similar to that of  Luxembourg.
However, a 2020 study speculates that theymay be underestimated.Rather, the researchers estimate bitcoin energy consumption accounts for “close to half of the current global data center electricity use.”
In China, researchers found that mining could eventhreaten carbon emission reduction targets.
In addition to the consumption of electricity, mining hardware is a contributor to the global e-waste problem.
Bitcoin mining began using simple GPU and CPUs. As the need for power grew, producers began creating unique chips.
Now, bulk mining uses Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). They are specifically for mining cryptocurrencies on the PoW algorithm.
Cryptocurrency mining is a highly competitive space. Only the most efficient machines operate at a profit. Mining ASICs are being constantly improved. As a result, each new generation introduced to the market means older machines become unprofitable.
The set number of coins and blocks motivates this constant improvement. As more efficient machines join the blockchain the total hashrate of the blockchain also increases.
The quantity of bitcoins that any given miner obtains is largely dependent on the portion of the hashrate generated. This makes older machines generate less profit while still consuming the same amount of power.
As a consequence, bitcoin miners buy an incredible quantity of computing devices. Which they cannot repurpose after they lose their edge.
As explained, crypto mining consumes a lot of energy. This is because bitcoin mining computers need electricity to run.
While this could have been a handful of miners at one point, the mining industry has grown with warehouses filled with machines constantly working.
As a result, if this system ran solely on electricity fuelled by fossil fuels it would be clear that it is detrimental to our diminishing resources.
However, exactly how much mining uses old-school electricity sources or renewable energy is up for debate.
A 2019 mining whitepaper by crypto research firm CoinShares found that74.1% of bitcoin mining is powered by renewable energy.This is their conservative estimate.
This is forward-thinking energy consumption is reflected in some mining operations. BitRiver, a colocation service for Bitcoin mining in Russia and the CIS countries, confirms that its plant only uses renewable energy.
“We use only renewable energy for our entire operation, which is currently utilizing over 70MW of power to mine crypto. As the demand from new and existing customers continues to increase, we are expanding our facility to utilize more of the total capacity of 100MW that our site has,” Bitriver COO, Dmitrii Ushakov tells BeinCrypto.
In addition to using renewable energy, some firms are attempting to lower the environmental cost of their operations.
Ushakov explains that his firm tries to help customers redistribute their hardware rather than throw it out. They help them sell the rigs on the resale. Often those interested are miners who have access to cheaper electricity so they can still run a profit.
“At the moment there is huge equipment demand from mining farms who get electricity at a very low rate. Depending on your electricity cost, which for some areas might be close to free, operating older second-hand mining machines is advantageous cost-wise. And after that, the equipment can be recycled like any other computer parts. Fans are reusable, and the housing could be repurposed,” a representative from blockchain hardware and software firm Bitmain explains.
However, this resale and recycle stance only postpones creating a great quantity of e-waste, rather than providing an actual solution to the problem.
Another way bitcoin miners are trying to offset their energy consumption is by using wasteful by-products. Partnering with other industries to use these resources to run their mining operations.
Bitcoin mining produces a lot of heat. According to the representative from Bitmain, the company uses this heat to keep rooms in their buildings normal in colder regions.
In another example, other miners are partnering with energy companies toutilize by-products to run their operations.In 2020, Crusoe Energy Solutions entered a deal with energy company Equinor to use the excess natural gas from its North Dakota oil field to mine bitcoin.
This gives Equinor an incentive not to simply flare the gas, which is harmful for the environment, and channel it into useful production.
While the answer to bitcoin’s energy problem seems like renewable energy, some believe it may not be enough.
A PwC blockchain specialist, Alex de Vries, outlines in his 2019 report on bitcoin’s sustainability thateven apparently “green” mining operations still contribute to environmental harm.
He explains that often renewable resources, such as hydropower, are seasonal and so cannot produce the year-round energy required by miners.
“Unlike the power demand of Bitcoin mining machines, which is consistent all year long, the production of hydropower is subject to seasonality. As a result, seasonal variability in hydropower is already higher than 30% and expected to increase further because of climate change,” he says in the report.
As a result, the need to mitigate these issues and continue mining sees a continued reliance on non-renewable coal and nuclear power.
It is hard to determine the extent of the damage crypto mining has on the environment. However, this doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be a concern of the crypto community.
Many consider bitcoin to be the key to a future that safeguards rights to freedom of speech, financial freedom and a democratized technology.
While it is a contributing to energy consumption, it is often called out among multiple industries that contribute the same or even more.
Gerry McGovern speaks about the masses of data currently consuming energy through wasteful storage in his 2020 book,World Wide Waste.
Giving examples of how many trees we would need to plant to offset data transactions. According to McGovern, statistics show that it would take 1.6 billion trees to offset the pollution caused by email spam.
In addition, 16 million trees to offset the pollution caused by the estimated 1.9 trillion yearly searches on Google.

As interest in cryptocurrencies expands, there is an increase in energy consumption. The energy consumption of the Bitcoin network made waves at the end of 2017. Even mainstream news outlets were reporting that it uses more electricity than the entire country of Ireland. At the time, the network consumed an estimated consume over 30 terawatt-hours (TWh) a year. This is less than its current consumption of 95.45 TWh , according to Digiconomist. The index explains that the yearly impact of bitcoin is 45.34 metric tons (mt) of CO2. This is comparable to Hong Kong. The coins 10.97 kt of e-waste is similar to that of  Luxembourg. However, a 2020 study speculates that they may be underestimated. Rather, the researchers estimate bitcoin energy consumption accounts for close to half of the current global data center electricity use. In China, researchers found that mining could even threaten carbon emission reduction targets. The environmental impact of mining hardware In addition to the consumption of electricity, mining hardware is a contributor to the global e-waste problem.

Non-fungible tokens are digital assets that represent a wide range of unique tangible and intangible items, from collectible sports cards to virtual real estate and even digital sneakers, CoinDesk explains. They are recorded on a blockchain, a distributed ledger that is immutable, verifiable and decentralized.
NFTs have been gaining a lot of traction — and dollars — lately, notably with Vignesh Sundaresan, also known as MetaKovan, who bought Christie’s first NFT for $69.34 million. Sundaresan told CNBC he was prepared to bid even higher.

In ablog, Christine Brown, Robinhood’s head of crypto operations, revealed that in the first quarter of 2021, 9.5 million of its customers traded crypto via the company’s platform. That’s up big time from the 1.7 million customers who traded crypto in the 2020 fourth quarter. The company first launched its Crypto unit in January of 2018 but hasn't provided numbers in previous quarters.
In February, Robinhoodrevealedit had seen six million new customers on Robinhood Crypto in the first two months of this year alone. That compares to a peak of 401,000 in a single month in 2020, with a monthly average of about 200,000 customers.
Brown says the company’s intent behind launching Robinhood Crypto in the first place was to give its customers the opportunity to buy and sell cryptocurrency in addition to the range of assets offered through its brokerage, Robinhood Financial.
Robinhood Crypto currently offers seven tradeable coins: Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV, Dogecoin, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic and Litecoin.
Will fading YOLO sentiment impact Robinhood, Coinbase and other trading platforms?
Brown also noted that Robinhood’s crypto team has already more than tripled since the beginning of the year, although it’s not entirely clear how many staffers it currently has on that team. There are a number of crypto-related openings on its careers site, including an open “Crypto CFO” role.
The company is making clear that crypto is an important part of its overall business and part of its mission to democratize access to the masses.
“All it takes to spend, trade, and store cryptocurrency, theoretically, is an internet connection — you don’t need access to a big line of credit, or startup capital,” Brown wrote. “You don’t even have to be awake at a certain time of day to trade. The crypto market doesn’t close. Crypto was born out of a mission to take power away from institutions and return it to the people.”
Last August, Robinhoodraised $200 million moreat a new, higher $11.2 billion valuation in its third raise of the year before filing togo publicin March.

A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin fall to an early morning intraday low $55,714.0 before making a move.
Steering clear of the first major support level at $54,798, Bitcoin rallied to a late intraday high $58,155.0.
Bitcoin broke through the first major resistance level at $57,882 before a fall back to $57,500 levels.
Finding late support, however, Bitcoin broke back through the first major resistance level to end the day at $58,000 levels.
The near-term bullish trend remained intact in spite of the latest pullback. For the bears, Bitcoin would need to slide through the 62% FIB of $26,041 to form a near-term bearish trend.
Across the rest of the majors, it was a bullish day on Thursday.
Ripple’s XRPjumped by 15.89% to lead the way, withBinance Coinrallying by 11.65%.
Cardano’s ADA(+4.02%),Chainlink(+5.35%),Crypto.com Coin(+7.31%),Ethereum(+5.93%), andLitecoin(+3.21%) also found strong support.
Bitcoin Cash SV(+2.79%) and Polkadot (+0.81%) trailed the front runners, however.
In the current week, the crypto total market rose to a Tuesday high $1,992bn before falling to a Wednesday low $1,783tn. At the time of writing, the total market cap stood at $1,920bn.
Bitcoin’s dominance rose to a Monday high 58.33% before falling to a Wednesday low 55.75%. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s dominance stood at 56.55%.
At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up by 0.05% to $58,138.3. A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin rise to an early morning high $58,239.0 before falling to a low $58,063.0.
Bitcoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.
Elsewhere, it was a mixed start to the day.
Cardano’s ADA and Polkadot were down by 0.17% and by 0.07% to buck the trend early on, with Binance Coin flat.
At the time of writing, Crypto.com Coin was up by 1.50%, however, to lead the way.
Bitcoin would need to avoid a fall through the pivot level at $57,326 to bring the first major resistance level at $58,939 into play.
Support from the broader market would be needed for Bitcoin to break out from $58,500 levels.
Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level and resistance at $59,000 would likely cap any upside.
In the event of an extended crypto rally, Bitcoin could test resistance at $60,000 before any pullback. The second major resistance level sits at $59,767.
A fall through the $57,326 pivot would bring the first major support level at $56,498 into play.
Barring another extended sell-off on the day, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$55,000 levels. The second major support level sits at $54,885.

2021-04-09 06:17:56+00:00,Victory for Amazon as majority of Alabama warehouse workers vote against union,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musks-neuralink-allows-monkey-061756673.html,The Telegraph,"Amazon has quashed a historic unionisation vote in Alabama that would have led to the creation of its first union in the US and
Workers at the Bessemer warehouse voted 1,798 to 738 against joining the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, labour officials said. The final tally is yet to come in.
The result means Amazon has avoided its biggest labour threat to date from its US workers, and has avoided its first unionised warehouse in America.
Around 5,800 people work at Amazon's Bessemer, Alabama facility and 3,215 cast a vote.
The union said it would file a legal challenge against both the election and claims of unfair labour practices against Amazon workers.
It has requested a hearing with the US labour regulator, the National Labor Relations Board to ""to determine if the results of the election should be set aside because conduct by the employer created an atmosphere of confusion, coercion and fear of reprisals and thus interfered with the employees' freedom of choice.""
All eyes were on Bessemer as a raft of Republican and Democrat politicians lent their support to the fight despite Amazon's fierce resistance. The election fuelled the debate on working conditions at one of the world's largest employers.
Last week Amazon admitted that itsdelivery drivers were sometimes forced to urinate in bottles while working.
It retracted a statement it made to a US politician in which it incorrectly denied an allegation made by US representative who criticised Amazon for claiming to be a “progressive workplace” while making “workers urinate in water bottles”.
That's all from us, enjoy your weekend!
Google has urged the US and Europe to form a technology trade council, warning that their relationship is “fraying”, comparing it with the US' relationship with China.
“This erosion of trade norms isn’t limited to the US-China relationship,"" Google wrote in a blog post on Friday. ""Even more concerningly, the technology trade relationship between the US and Europe — once one of the closest in the world — is fraying.”
Google used the open letter to lobby against Europe's ""broad series of unilateral initiatives in areas ranging from digital taxes to market regulation"" claiming that the failure to create global policies around technology trade matters had become an ""afterthought"" that risked harming ""the 16 million jobs on both sides of the Atlantic linked to transatlantic trade and investment"".
Google is passing on the costs of anew digital services taxto British advertisers, thwarting the government’s plan to claw back some of the revenuegenerated by the Silicon Valley giant on British shores.
Although the results are yet to be announced, counts show that the majority of Amazon workers have voted against a union in Alabama, which means the online retailer has avoided its biggest labour threat to date.
The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union said it will challenge the results.
""This particular union can't give us anything that Amazon does not already offer,"" LaVonette Stokes, a Bessemer employee who voted against unionising, told NPR.
""There are a [lot] of people who never have issues.""
The counting of votes in Alabama for a historic vote on unionisation by Amazon warehouse workers has resumed this afternoon.
The vote, carried out by post since February, represents one of the most serious unionisation efforts of Amazon workers in recent years.
Amazon looks set to prevail in the vote, with most of the warehouse workers who voted deciding not to unionise.
The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which organised the unionisation attempt, has said that 55pc of the warehouse’s 6,000 workers voted.
Amazon has lobbied against the unionisation attempt, encouraging workers not to vote in favour of it in in-person meetings as well as online messages.
A top Google executive has warned that relations between the European Union and the US are “fraying” and urged the Biden administration to join the EU-US Trade and Technology Council.
Writing in a blog post, Google’s vice president of government affairs & public policy Karan Bhatia said that “we’re seeing the erosion of a carefully nurtured global trading system.”
“This erosion of trade norms isn’t limited to the US-China relationship,” he continued. “Even more concerningly, the technology trade relationship between the US and Europe — once one of the closest in the world — is fraying.”
He has called on the US to engage with the EU on technology regulation. Doing so could bring about a “non-discriminatory approach,” he said.
Scientists at General Electric (GE) are developing a new sensor that can fit inside a smartphone to detect virus such as Covid-19.
“One of the first lines of defence against any virus is avoiding exposure, which is easier said than done when you can’t see it,” said Radislav Potyrailo, a principal scientist at GE Research.
“We are developing a sensor small enough to embed in a mobile device that could detect the presence of the Covid-19 virus.”
According toFast Company, the sensor would include nanowells that can capture viruses. Within those weels is an organic solven customised with nucleic acids to make the virus stick.
An electrode at the base of the well will send electricity into the object to measure whether the captured virus is, for instance, Covid-19 or something else.
LinkedIn users are being warned about a scam that by a group of criminals called 'Golden Chicken' that targets job hunters. .
A report from security firm eSentire details how “Golden Chicken” is sending out fake employments offers in a bid to steal personal data.
Here is eSentire's explanation of how it works:
Hackers are spearphishing victims with a malicious zip file using the job position listed on the target’s LinkedIn profile.
For example, if the LinkedIn member’s job is listed asSenior Account Executive—International Freightthe malicious zip file would be titledSenior Account Executive—International Freight position (note the “position” added to the end).Upon opening the fake job offer, the victim unwittingly initiates the stealthy installation of the fileless backdoor, more_eggs.
Once loaded, the sophisticated backdoor can download additional malicious plugins and provide hands-on access to the victim’s computer.
India’s is testing out facial recognition technology to identify people queuing at Covid-19 vaccination centres and create a national list of those who have had the vaccine.
The system using facial scans taken under India's Aadhaar naitional ID scheme, according to theRegister.
With 99pc of Indian adults enrolled in the scheme, Aadhaar is the world's largest biometric ID database.
Launched in 2009 by Nandan Nilekani, one of the founders of Indian technology outsourcing giant Infosys, it was originally viewed as a way of registering Indians - millions of whom lack birth certificates or other ID - so they could access their rightful welfare payments and prevent the mass pilfering of state subsidy schemes.
In exchange for providing fingerprints, face and retina scans, people who sign up for Aadhaar get a 12-digit ID number. The cards cover welfare and tax payments as well as the ability to access social services. Now, they're being tied to Covid status.
China's government on Friday criticised the Biden administration's curbs on access to U.S. technology for its supercomputer developers and said sanctions ""only strengthen China's determination"" to invent its own.
The sanctions announced Thursday are the latest sign President Joe Biden is sticking to the tough line taken by his predecessor, Donald Trump, toward Chinese tech industries seen by Washington as potential threats.
The step adds to conflict over the ruling Communist Party's industrial plans, access to American technology and accusations of computer attacks and theft of business secrets.
A foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, accused Washington of misusing phony security warnings to ""maliciously suppress"" Chinese industry.
""Containment and suppression by the United States cannot stop the pace of China's scientific and technological progress, but will only strengthen China's determination and will to innovate independently,"" Zhao said.
Zhao said Beijing would protect its companies, echoing Chinese warnings after previous U.S. trade penalties that often are followed by no action.
The latest penalties block access to US technology for researchers and manufacturers the Commerce Department said build supercomputers used by the Chinese military in weapons development. They can be used to simulate nuclear explosions and the aerodynamics of high-speed or stealth aircraft and missiles.
Cybersecurity experts are urging people to create harder-to-crack passwords after new research found 15pc of British people use their pet's name as a log-in.
The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) argues that such passwords can make it easier for hackers to force their way into people's accounts by simply guessing common pet names.
It comes after a survey commissioned by the centre, which is part of GCHQ, found that many people were using passwords made up of things which can be easily predicted - including a pet's name (15pc), the name of a family member (14pc), a significant date (13pc) or a favourite sports team (6pc).
In addition, a further 6pc admitted they used the word ""password"" as all or part of their password.
The NCSC study also found that more than a quarter of people had set up at least four new password-protected accounts in the last year, which the organisation said further highlighted the importance of using strong passwords, with more data than ever to protect.
Facebook is being publicly criticised again forhosting fake review sales groups, with the social network announcing today that it has deleted 16,000 groups.
An investigation carried out by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) found that a thriving network of groups selling fake or misleading online reviews remained on Facebook,despite the company promising last yearto stamp out the practice.
As well as deleting the groups, Facebook has said it will suspend or ban repeat offenders in the world of fake reviews and announced that it would use automated technology to stop the groups reforming.
Facebook has also said it will make it harder for people to search for fake reviews groups on its main site as well as Instagram.
Andrea Coscelli, the chief executive of the CMA, said that “Facebook has a duty to do all it can to stop the trading of such content on its platforms. After we intervened again, the company made significant changes – but it is disappointing it has taken them over a year to fix these issues.”
“We will continue to keep a close eye on Facebook, including its Instagram business,” he added. “Should we find it is failing to honour its commitments, we will not hesitate to take further action.”
The Government’sdecision to allow trials of electric scooter rental businesseson public highways in the UK has led to the apps being downloaded 390,000 times in the UK, according to App Annie data.
Local councils were able to hold trials of the apps, which let people pay per minute to rent the electric scooters, from last year.
Fierce competition has broken out in the field, with up to 20 rival businesses bidding for the same contracts.
So far, it appears that Swedish operator Voi has picked up the most downloads in the UK. The company poached its UK head, Richard Corbett, from US rival Bird.
Shares in food delivery business Deliveroo have dropped 2pc today, pushing the company’s stock even further below its 390p float price.
Deliveroo shares fell as low as 272p on Friday,strengthening analyst concernsthat the business is unlikely to see enough interest from retail traders to recover its sizeable losses from last week’s float.
The company had one of the worst stock market debuts in record when its share price collapsed 26pc, wiping £2bn off its valuation.
Technology investors have in recent years backed a number of artificial meat businesses, hoping that they can benefit from a move away from costly meat production.
US business Impossible Foods, which has been backed by a number of prominent technology investors, is reportedly planning to float in the US which could bring its valuation to as high as $10bn (£7.3bn),Reuters reports.
The business raised money last year at a $4bn valuation. The float could be a traditional listing taking place in the next 12 months or a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (commonly known as a “SPAC”).
An Impossible Foods float would be welcomed by its investors including Google Ventures, Khosla Ventures, Viking Global Investors and Bill Gates.
A closely-watched vote of workers at an Amazon warehouse in Alabama appeared to suggest that the e-commerce giant has prevailed in its attempt to fight unionisation efforts overnight.
The vote, carried out by post since February, represents one of the most serious unionisation efforts of Amazon workers in recent years.
A count of the vote livestreamed over Zoom last night was paused with 1,100 votes against unionisation and 463 in support.
Journalists watching the count tallied the votes by hand. Counting will resume later today.
The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which organised the unionisation attempt, has said that 55pc of the warehouse’s 6,000 workers voted.
Amazon has lobbied against the unionisation attempt, encouraging workers not to vote in favour of it in in-person meetings as well as online messages.
When Elon Musk isn’t attempting to revolutionise the car industry with Tesla or take humanity to Mars with SpaceX, he likes to relax by helping humans control computers with their brain using his other start-up Neuralink.
The company has given an update on its progress, showing a macaque monkey controlling a computer using an implant that Neuralink inserted into its brain.
The monkey, keen to receive a tasty smoothie, learns to control the games on-screen by moving a joystick.
Neuralink learns how the monkey’s brain issues controls to its arm to move the joystick, and eventually the joystick was unplugged and removed, leaving the monkey able to control the game using just its brain.
Musk’s plan is for Neuralink to eventually work for humans, allowing paralysed people to type on their smartphone using their mind, for example. If the technology continues to develop, he hopes that it could help paralysed people to walk again.

What Happened: Gina Sanchez, CEO of Chantico Global and chief market strategist at Lido Advisors,saidthe answer depended on whether investors value the reopening trade and catch-up or whether they valued long-term growth.
Sanchez noted that if the reopening trade is valued, Apple got hit the hardest last year as people chose not to upgrade their phones or computers. However, the expectations for 2021 as well as 2022 are very strong and the catch-up trade in Apple is very good.
Microsoft, on the other hand, has a very long track record of growth and the expectations are even brighter after the pandemic than before the pandemic, according to Sanchez. During the pandemic, the company continued with the build-out of their Azure Suite and Stack.

Based on just pure valuation, Microsoft is actually not trading at as high a premium as Apple is, according to Sanchez. Even though Apple is absolutely cheaper, Microsoft is actually cheaper relative to its own history, she said.
JC O’Hara, chief market technician at MKM Partners, said that Microsoft is clearly the stronger chart and its stock has already broken out above its February highs to reach all-time highs.
However, he feels that Apple could be the best trade to buy right now as the trade he is looking at is a catch-up trade. He predicted that Apple is going to run up to test its February highs.
O’Hara said that just as Microsoft last week began to break out to new highs, Apple will also do likewise soon.

Why It Matters:Shares of Microsoft hit a record high for the second straight day on Thursday, while Apple has not reached a new high since touching a new 52-week high on January 25 and has even fallen 10% since then.
Apple has a market capitalization of $2.18 trillion, while Microsoft has a market capitalization of $1.91 trillion. Apple’s year-to-date returns are negative 3.5%, while Microsoft has returned year-to-date gains of 12.6%.
Price Action: Apple shares closed 1.9% higher on Thursday at $130.36 and further rose almost 0.4% in the after-hours session. Microsoft shares closed 1.3% higher on Thursday at $253.25 and further rose almost 0.3% in the after-hours session.

As CoinDeskreportedearlier this week, 652 public officials in Ukraine reported owning 46,351 bitcoin (BTC), worth around US$2.67 billion at the recent price, in their obligatory property declaration. The numbers raised eyebrows, especially when it came to individual declarations.
For example, Vyacheslav Mishalov, a member of the Dnipro city council, reported owning 18,000 bitcoin; Petro Lensky, first secretary of Ukraine’s embassy in Vietnam, said he had 6,528 BTC; and Alexander Urbansky, deputy chairman of the Odessa regional council, reported holding 5,328 BTC.
Related:Is Coinbase the Next Netflix, or a Blockbuster Video-in-Waiting?
It turned out, however, those numbers should be taken with a pinch of salt. On Friday, Mishalov said he made a mistake and “skipped the line” with crypto in his declaration and actually he doesn’t have that much BTC.
That admission came right after Ukraine’s anti-corruption authorities took notice of the whopping numbers declared by public officials. Following thereportby the data analytics project Opendatabot on Thursday, the head of the office of mandatory full inspections at the National Agency for the Prevention of Corruption (NAPC)saidon his Facebook page that the agency will look into the reported holdings.
“When checking the declaration, we will see whether the declarant really owns the specified number of crypto tokens, whether the money for its purchase was really transferred and whether the declarant can explain the origin of the money spent on the purchase of tokens,” NAPC’s Sergiy Petukhov wrote. He added that filing a false declaration might lead to a criminal investigation.
The next day, Mishalov told a Ukrainian TV channel he actually doesn’t own that much bitcoin, although he does have some.

“I do have some bitcoin, quite a lot actually, but of course not that much,” Mishalovsaid. “I was amending my previous declaration and didn’t update that line. I wrote a letter to NAPC and you will soon see the updated declaration.”
Another self-declared crypto whale, Alexander Urbansky, told the journalists he bought bitcoin in 2009 at the price of $1.
Alex Bornyakov, the deputy minister for digital transformation of Ukraine, said public officials in Ukraine might be claiming to own large amounts of cryptocurrencies as a plausible explanation of ill-gotten income.
Michael Chobanyan, founder of the Ukrainian crypto exchange Kuna, told CoinDesk crypto is often used to explain why a civil servant happens to own a lot of money he or she couldn’t have possibly gained in a legal manner.
“Previously, they would declare royalties from books. Now they might simply say they sold some crypto and here’s how they could buy that villa in Italy,” Chobanyan said. He added that, in practice, nobody would check such claims so they often might be outright false.
He believes 99,9% of the crypto Ukrainian public officials declared this year are bogus numbers. “Some do hold crypto, but not that much,” he added.

2021-04-09 10:46:09+00:00,"Apple wont put iMessage on Android in order to keep users locked-in, court documents reveal",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-won-t-put-imessage-104609125.html,The Independent,"(Getty Images) Apple could have made a version of iMessage that works on Android devices but chose not to in order to keep people buying iPhones. Revealed through court documents submitted as part of the legal battle between Fortnite publisher Epic Games and Apple, the Cupertino smartphone giant had made a decision as early as 2013 to not develop its messaging platform for competing phones. There would have been cross-compatibility with the iOS platform so that users of both platforms would have been able to exchange messages with one another seamlessly, said Eddy Cue, Apples Senior Vice President of Software and Services. However, this idea was shot down by Craig Federighi , Apples Senior Vice President of Software Engineering and the executive in charge of iOS, saying that iMessage on Android would simply serve to remove [an] obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones. Mr Federighi also said it would be a horrible idea to make it easier for someone to switch away from our platforms. The lack of iMessage on Android is one felt strongly by consumers, especially in the United States where iPhones make up nearly 50 per cent of the market. This is because iMessage works better than the default messaging apps on Android phones, which can lack functions such as read receipts, high-quality attachments, and typing indicators. Google has been attempting to push RCS (Rich Communication Services), the successor to SMS texting which would allow for these functions, since 2018, but have been hampered by the business decisions of large phone companies who control how the process is implemented. Competing messaging services, like WhatsApp and Signal, are also used less in the United States. Only 20 per cent of US adults said they used WhatsApp in 2019 , compared to the 69 per cent who used its parent company, Facebook. The disparity is so great that Apples own employees had noticed it. In 2016, when a former Apple employee commented that the #1 most difficult [reason] to leave the Apple universe app is iMessage . . . iMessage amounts to serious lock-in to the Apple ecosystem, the court documents state, Phil Schiller, former Senior Vice President of Worldwide Product Marketing, said: moving iMessage to Android will hurt us more than help us, this email illustrates why. Story continues Apples control over its ecosystem is a key issue in this court case. Apple removed Fortnite from iPhones and iPads after Epic Games attempted to implement a workaround for users to purchase in-app items without using Apples App Store  thereby circumventing the 30 per cent cut that Apple takes from all purchases. Epic Games, and other third-party developers including Spotify and Protonmail , have claimed that Apple has near total control over the mobile ecosystem and what apps consumers get to use  with no oversight, regulation, or fair competition. However, the smartphone giants grip on its software has loosened as watchdogs launch investigations into suspected anti-competitive behaviour. Apples iOS 14.5 software update allows users to change the default music app to competitors such as Spotify or Deezer, swapping Safari to other browsers like Google Chrome or Brave , and change the Mail client to Gmail or Outlook . Apple did not respond to a request for comment from The Independent before time of publication.

2021-04-09 10:51:06+00:00,Bitcoin Miners Are Again Stacking Coins in a Positive Sign for the Market,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-miners-again-stacking-coins-105106529.html,CoinDesk,"Blockchain data showsbitcoinminers are accumulating coins and adding to bullish pressures in the market for the first time since December.
Analytics firm Glassnode’s miner position change metric, which gauges the 30-day change in the supply held in the miners’ addresses, recently turned positive in a sign of renewed holding by those responsible for making coins.
The balance held in miner wallets has increased by 4,435 BTC to 1.806 million over the past two weeks, Glassnode’s data shows.

“Miners [now] have a net accumulation of liquid assets as they have enough cash in reserve to run their future operations, having liquidated holdings when the bitcoin price was between $20,000 and $40,000, or most of them are holding in anticipation of a price rally,” Flex Yang, CEO of Hong Kong-based Babel Finance, said in an email.
Miners predominantly operate on cash and liquidate holdings to meet expenses. However, the pace of miner selling varies from time to time depending on mining-specific factors and bitcoin’s price expectations.
The return to accumulation mode observed since March 31 comes after almost four months of largely negative readings – miners decreasing positions and taking profits. Peak distribution of roughly 17,000 BTC to 24,000 BTC was seen throughout January, according to Glassnode’s weekly newsletter,dated March 8.
While miner flows constitute a small part of the total network volume,as tweeted byGlassnode’s CEO Rafael Schultze-Kraft, accumulation by miners is analogous to increased promoter holding of corporate stock and is considered a positive indicator. “Their spending patterns provide insight into the sentiment of some of the biggest bulls in the Bitcoin market,”Glassnode saidin a newsletter published on April 5.

Whales, or large investors with the ability to influence prices, have also stopped selling coins.
The number of whale entities – clusters of crypto wallet addresses held by a single network participant holding at least 1,000 bitcoin – has steadied above 2,000 since March 31.
The figure dropped from 2,230 to 2,004 in nearly two months to March 31, mainly due to quarter-end rebalancing,according toblockchain analyst Willy Woo. It remains to be seen if these positive on-chain developments fuel the next leg higher in the cryptocurrency.
While bitcoin is currently trading moderately higher on the day near $58,500, it remains trapped in a narrowing price range. A breakout would mark a continuation of the broader uptrend typically experienced in the seasonally strong month of April.

But in the bitcoin market, the episode has proven to be a disappointment to some traders who were speculating last month that a new wave of demand might help push prices to fresh highs.
“It would be very difficult to get a full picture of how that money moved from Uncle Sam into bitcoin,” said Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics, a market analysis firm based in Tel Aviv, during an interview with CoinDesk.

Biden signed the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill into law on March 11, and the $1,400 stimulus payments started going out soon afterward, many of them viadirect deposit into recipients’ bank accounts.
Soon afterward, some cryptocurrency traders began to speculate whether some of that money might be used to buy bitcoin. Mizuho Securities, a Japanese brokerage firm, estimated that$40 billion of stimulus checks could be spent on bitcoinand stocks, according to a survey published on March 15.
As recently as late last month, no cryptocurrency exchanges reported any major bump in $1,400 purchases, based on aninformal survey by CoinDesk. Industry executives cautioned that it might be too early to judge.
Now, those purchases do appear to be happening, according to some firms, even if they’re not the tsunami that some bitcoin bulls might have expected.

“We have seen a significant number of deposits in the amount of the latest individual stimulus check,” Steve Ehrlich, CEO of U.S. cryptocurrency brokerage Voyager Digital, told CoinDesk in an email sent by a spokesperson.
Kraken, a San Francisco-based exchange, has seen an “uptick that may well stem from U.S. stimulus checks,” according to Thomas Perfumo, the company’s head of business operations and strategy.
But the rise in $1,400 “stimmy” deposits hasn’t been enough to bid up bitcoin.
Over the past month, BTC has struggled to decisively break above $60,000 amid slugglish trading activity. Slowing volume istypical of a consolidation phasein price action, diverging from the BTC price uptrend seen earlier in the year.
Traders could be waiting to accumulate BTC at lower support levels, especially given the near two-fold price increase this year.
“We expect weak BTC support around $56,000 down to $52,000, and stronger BTC support starting at $44,000 down to $42,000,” wrote Justin Chuh, senior trader at Wave Financial, a digital asset investment fund. “BTC resistance remains at $60,000.”
Retail traders aren’t the only ones on standby; institutional demand is also slowing. “The drop-off in volume has been more related to institutional volume going down, especially with the decline in futures market volatility,” said Hunter Merghart, head of U.S. operations at Bitstamp, a cryptocurrency exchange based in Luxembourg.
“We’re seeing new institutions coming on board from traditional finance backgrounds, ramping up deposits on the platform,” Merghart said. “These are buy-and-hold clients, unlikeprop shopsin 2017.”
Retail accounts make up about 80% of deposits on Bitstamp. The company experienced growth in retail deposits under $2,000 over the past month when U.S. stimulus checks were issued, Merghart told CoinDesk during a phone interview.
Robinhood, an online brokerage app,saidThursday that 9.5 million customers traded cryptocurrencies during the first three months of the year, up from 1.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2020.
There just wasn’t much of a bitcoin stimulus.
“I wasn’t expecting stimmies to pump bitcoin,” said Greenspan, of Quantum Economics. “There are much bigger players in the market now.”

Cryptocurrency like Bitcoin is traded on special exchanges like Etoro, CoinBase and BlockFi. The biggest exchange in the world by far is called Binance. It’s so big, in fact, that a “native” cryptocurrency called Binance Coin was developed just to make it easier to pay for the site’s services.
Read:Bitcoin Cash (BCH): How’s It Differ From Bitcoin and What’s It Worth?
If you’re not familiar with crypto exchanges, the following numbers might not mean much to you, but the 1.4 million transactions that are executed on Binance every second and the site’s 2 billion in average daily volume are truly astounding statistics. Exchanges take fees for executing crypto transactions, and part of the reason Binance is so popular is that its transaction fees are among the lowest in the world. Users pay just 0.1% to execute each of those billions of trades.
Binance reduces those already-low trading fees by a full 50% if you pay for them using the exchange’s native cryptocurrency, Binance Coin (BNB).That means that instead of paying 10 cents on a $100 transaction, you’d pay only 5 cents if you complete the transaction using BNB.
An Ethereum-based (ERC-20) token, BNB hit the market on July 21, 2017, when Binance made its initial coin offering (ICO) of 100 million BNB tokens. It eventually moved to its own unique blockchain called Binance Chain and limited the BNB supply to 200 million tokens in total.

In review, BNB is the native app for Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. It was designed specifically for use in the Binance ecosystem, which offers juicy rebates to incentivize its use — but there’s more to Binance Coin than just the trading discount. According to CoinJournal, BNB:
• Provides lightning-fast transactions
• Can be used to buy and sell a huge variety of cryptocurrencies
• Is safe and secure
• Is accepted as currency by some service providers, mostly in the hospitality/travel industry

On April 6, Forbes reported that the cryptocurrency market had topped $2 trillion in value. It was a huge moment for crypto, and Forbes cited BNB specifically as one of the smaller altcoins (Bitcoin alternatives) that are driving so much of that incredible growth.
But investors looking for a quick buck should tread lightly.
Beyond the crypto bubble, BNB is not yet widely accepted as currency outside the travel, accommodations and entertainment industries, although some investment platforms let you use it to buy mainstream securities. It’s just as trustworthy as non-native crypto, but it’s not as anonymous since Binance traders must have registered accounts. In the end, it’s another altcoin that you can invest in if you choose, but like all crypto investments, expect a wild ride with ecstatic highs, terrifying drops andlots of drama in between. That, after all, has been the story of crypto investing so far.

This week’s hateful eight altcoins are:
• Klaytn (KLAY) – 23.22%
• Ankr (ANKR) – 15.06%
• Maker (MKR) – 13.52%
• BTMX (BTMX) – 12.75%
• Theta Fuel (TFUEL) – 12.65%
• Filecoin (FIL) – 11.93%
• Terra (LUNA) – 11.31%
• ICON (ICX) – 9.63%
KLAY has been moving upwards since Feb. 17, having increased by 500% in only 44 days.
However, it dropped once it reached an all-time high price of $4.35 on April 2. So far, it has decreased by 27% and has just reached the $3.20 support area.
There is a hidden bullish divergence at play, indicating possible trend continuation.
If the support area holds, KLAY could make another attempt at the all-time high. Beyond that, the next resistance level will likely be found at $5.
ANKR increased rapidly in February/March, culminating with an all-time high price of $0.216 on March 28.
However, it proceeded to decrease for ten days, reaching a low of $0.119 on April 7. This marked a 45% drop from the highs.
ANKR has bounced since. It did so soon as it reached the 0.618 Fib retracement support.
However, technical indicators are bearish. Furthermore, it is possible that ANKR has completed its long-term bullish impulse and now appears to be in a corrective phase.
On a positive note, ANKR is releasing its first NFTon April 2.
MKR has been moving downwards since Feb. 20. The initial drop measured 42%.
Afterward, it began trading inside a descending wedge. I broke out from this pattern on March 28.
Since then, it’s been trading inside a range between $1,900-$2,500.
BTMX increased by more than 400% in March, culminating with an all-time high price of $3.27 on March 27.
However, the drop that followed was just as swift. It measured 60% and took BTMX to the 0.618 Fib retracement level at $1.26.
Despite being at crucial horizontal and Fib supports, BTMX is now showing bullish reversal signs.
TFUEL has been decreasing since March 24, when it reached a high of $0.568. While it initially bounced, it has fallen below the $0.40 area since.
Until it reclaims this level, the trend cannot be considered bullish.
The closest support area is found at $0.295.
FIL has been moving downwards since April 1. On this day it reached an all-time high price of $238.20 and created a shooting star candlestick.
Despite the ongoing decrease, which has so far measured 30%, FIL seems to be in wave four of a bullish impulse.
Therefore, another upward move seems likely. In addition to this, FIL was listed on the NAMI exchangeon April 5.This could have had a positive effect on its price.
LUNA has been decreasing since reaching a high of $22.40 on March 21.
The decrease has taken the shape of adescending wedge,which is normally considered a bullish reversal pattern.
In addition, there is a bullish divergence developing in theMACD, indicating a potential reversal.
If so, LUNA could make another attempt at its all-time highs.
On April 1, itlaunchedKash, a mobile banking application.
ICX has been moving downwards since March 31, when it reached a high of $3.20.
However, it bounced once it reached the $2.40 support area and broke out from a descending resistance line after.
Technical indicators are bullish, and the token seems to be making another attempt at moving towards the $3.20 highs.

The world’s second largest cryptocurrency has risen by more than 175% since the turn of the year and a staggering 1,156% in the past 12 months. It has recently benefited from a period of sideways consolidation in the price of Bitcoin, which has led to market-wide rallies across the majority of altcoins like Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash. In the immediate future, Coinbase’s upcoming direct listing on Nasdaq next week is expected the be a positive step forwards for the entire industry, although it’s worth noting that traders may look to “sell the news” over an event of this nature. ETHUSD chart by TradingView If hype and optimism can be sustained until next Wednesday’s listing, Ethereum is being predicted to form a new all-time high this weekend with aggressive upside price targets coming in at around $2,275. However, if the wider market begins to correct, the correlation in assets would see Ethereum slump back below $2,000 to test the prior low of $1,933, with another potential target at $1,850.

Whinstone is North America’s largest Bitcoin hosting facility.
Riot Blockchain willpurchaseall of Whinstone’s assets and operations for $80 million in cash and 11.8 million shares of Riot common stock. At roughly $50 per share, that amount of stock is currently worth $590 million.
With 300 MW currently developed, Whinstone’s facility has a projected power capacity of 750 MW. Riot hopes this will make it the largest publicly tradedBitcoin miningand hosting company in North America.
CEO Jason Les said Whinstone will become the “foundation” of the company’s Bitcoin mining operations.
A significant purchase made the day before the acquisition’s announcement will certainly bolster these ambitions. On April 7, Riotannouncedthat it had purchased 42,000 S19j Antminers from Bitmain Technologies Ltd. for $138.5 million.
This would increase the company’s 4.0 exahash rate per second (EH/s), expected by October 2021, by 93% once fully implemented. Bitmain will deliver a minimum of 3,500 S19j Antminers on a monthly basis starting in November 2021. Once Riot receives the final shipment in October 2022, it projects that its capacity will be 7.7 EH/s.
“Riot’s existing fleet of miners has already positioned the Company as an American leader in Bitcoin mining,” said Megan Brooks, COO of Riot. “By nearly doubling its planned hash rate capacity, Riot continues to take great strides forward in growing both the Company’s and the United States’ share of the global network hash rate.”
Once fully implemented, 95% of Riot’s fleet of about 81,150 Antminers, will consist of the latest generation S19 model. This total fleet is expected to consume approximately 257.6 MW of energy. Riot’s acquisition of Whinstone will more than enable it to fulfill that capacity.
Riot Blockchain acknowledged that the purchase was significant, in light of the current period’s scarce supply of Bitcoin mining hardware. The ability for many miners to grow their hash rate has been compromised by the global shortage of semiconductor production.
Fortunately, Riot has enjoyed a positive, long-term relationship with Bitmain. The company had previouslypurchased2,500 S19 Antminer miners from Bitmain for $6.1 million in October 2020.
“We are excited for our long-term cooperation with Riot as they continue to solidify their growth and position as one of the global leading companies in Bitcoin mining,” said Irene Gao, Antminer Sales Director of NCSA Region for Bitmain. “With their new order of Bitmain’s next-gen Antminers, this will assure the rapid growth and long-term investment of their mining operations.”",4,0.9,"The article highlights Riot Blockchain's strategic acquisitions and partnerships, indicating strong growth potential and leadership in the Bitcoin mining sector.",3,0.75,"The significant investment in expanding mining capacity could lead to increased centralization of Bitcoin mining power, raising concerns over network security and decentralization."

Through this investment, Evangelion Capital is continuing its mission of bootstrapping the pioneers of blockchain.
Austin, TX, April 09, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Raze Network is a substrate-based cross-chain privacy protocol for the Polkadot ecosystem. It will enable cross-chain privacy-preserving payment and trading systems while protecting the transparency of users’ assets and behaviors from surveillance.
The team at Evangelion Capital believes Raze Network to be one of the most promising projects in the blockchain industry and is pleased to have forged a long-term partnership with such an enterprising startup.
Backed By Who’s Who Of Blockchain Investors
Evangelion Capital's investment capped off an immensely popular private sale round that was participated by industry giants such as Master Ventures, X21 Digital, AU21 Capital, Spark Digital Capital, Signum Capital, AngelONE, Kyros Ventures, Arpa Labs, Lotus Capital, Tenzor Capital, and Block Dream Fund.
Raze Network has been making noises from the get-go, with its technical facets being consistently quoted by blockchain experts as revolutionary for privacy protocol. Raze Network is building a cross-chain privacy middleware for DeFi and Web3.0, with the aim of reconstructing the privacy layer for the current crypto sphere and eventually spanning to the general internet users.
A catalyst for Blockchain innovation
The launch of Raze Network is sure to shift the current paradigm in DeFi, and perfectly synchronizes with Evangelion Capital's goal to act as a catalyst for widespread blockchain adoption and innovation. Here's what Lars B Jacobson, Cofounder, and head of investments at Evangelion Capital had to say:
""We were enthralled by Raze Network's vision from the moment we read the project's whitepaper. Our team at Evangelion Capital has been in the blockchain industry from the early days of Bitcoin and has seen the sector evolve at an unimaginable pace. However, very rarely do we come across projects such as Raze Network with a clear vision and solid use-case. Raze Network achieves several technological milestones in decentralized privacy protocol space and is built on Substrate for the Polkadot ecosystem. We believe the cutting-edge zkSNARKs that will power the decentralized anonymous module will transform the privacy middleware for DeFi and Web 3.0. Evangelion Capital is delighted to have partnered with Raze Network, and believe this is just the start of a very exciting journey as pioneers in blockchain""
This investment is a massive show of faith by the firm in Raze Network’s inherent potential. Evangelion Capital is renowned for its foresight, tracing its origins to a bunch of friends arguing about hash rates on Bitcointalk forums when bitcoin was in three digits and only traded on shady exchanges. Since then Evangelion has organically grown into a respected investor with an in-depth knowledge of blockchain and the various marketing facets of the industry.
Evangelion Capital's strategic investment into Raze Network comes just before the project’s triple IDO, Eco Launch and Balancer Liquidity Bootstrapping pool for token $RAZE starting on April 12th, 2021 with Uniswap listing on April 16th, 2021.

2021-04-09 13:00:33+00:00,CipherTrace Wants to Introduce DEXs to Sanctions Compliance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ciphertrace-wants-introduce-dexs-sanctions-130033119.html,CoinDesk,"Crypto analytics firm CipherTrace is adding to its list of regulatory compliance tools with a new sanctions-friendly address tracker for decentralized exchanges (DEXs).
Announced Friday, the new DeFi Compli tool creates an oracle on Chainlink that details crypto wallet addresses on government watchlist, such as the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions list. DEXs or other decentralized smart contracts could tap these lists and prevent transactions from touching sanctioned addresses.
“What we’ve seen in the U.S. at least is really a focus on sanctions,” said John Jefferies, chief financial analyst and marketing officer for CipherTrace. “That’s the angle regulators are most concerned about right now and one of the things that has crept into the latest [Financial Action Task Force draft guidance] wasproliferation financing.”
Related:XRP Doubles in 7 Days, Heads for Biggest Weekly Gain Since December 2017
A handful of cryptocurrency addresses are already on OFAC’s sanctions list, allegedly tied tocybercriminals,theft,drug smugglersandelection interference.
A press release announcing the new tool claimed implementing some form of crypto crime monitoring in decentralized finance (DeFi) is timely. The increasing amount ofvalue locked in DeFi– currently some $51.4 billion, according to DeFi Pulse – presents an “even bigger target” for malicious actors, CipherTrace CEO Dave Jevans said in a statement.
More specifically, decentralized products that facilitate traditional financial activities like lending still fall within existing regulations, CipherTrace said, pointing to a 2020 speech by Securities and Exchange Commission digital asset head Valerie Szczepanik.
The regulatory crypto czar warned at the Chamber of Digital Commerce’s 2020 Parallel Summit that securities, banking, lending and anti-money laundering (AML) laws all apply to these financial activities.

The latestin a setof know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML)productslaunched by CipherTrace, the new DeFi Compli is fairly simple: CipherTrace runs its own Chainlink node, and has set up an oracle it can update that contains a list of sanctioned addresses or funds.
Developers of DEXs or other DeFi smart contracts can set up an API call to the oracle, creating a function on their platforms that would prevent sanctioned addresses from sending funds through the DEX or contract, and similarly prevent users from sending funds to the sanctioned addresses.
“Right now we’re really looking at screening the addresses, not the individuals, so from their perspective they would on-ramp onto the DEX from their wallet, maybe from their MetaMask, [and] the DEX itself would ping the compliance oracle and say ‘is this an OFAC-sanctioned address,’” Jefferies said. “From the user perspective, unless it is an OFAC-sanctioned address, it would be transparent and frictionless.”
Jefferies said he hopes to expand the service as it evolves. While it’s only looking at specifically sanctioned sources at the moment, a future iteration could evaluate whether the source of funds is otherwise linked to illicit activity.
In his view, the crypto sector, including decentralized platforms that aspire to be stateless, must comply with regulations voluntarily or risk being shut down forcefully.
DEXs are virtual asset service providers, Jefferies said, referring to the term the Financial Action Task Force uses in its guidance around crypto exchange regulation. If the crypto sector can prove that DEXs can still comply with existing regulations, entities like FATF may focus less on carving out specific rules for developers or projects.
“Like it or not, the whole decentralized community needs to address this. Otherwise the [regulations are] going to come down in full force and the ripple effect might hit the rest of the decentralized world,” he said.

He explained his success comes from lucrative arbitrage opportunities in crypto.
Bankman-Fried launched a crypto-trading firm called Alameda Research in 2017. The company now manages over $100 million in digital assets. The firm’s large-scale trades made Bankman-Fried a self-made billionaire by the age of 29. He is also the CEO and founder of the FTX Exchange, a cryptocurrency derivatives trading exchange.
Upon entering the crypto markets, hediscoveredthat Bitcoin was growing very rapidly in trading volumes. This meant there would also be large price discrepancies, making it ideal for arbitrage, taking advantage of the price differences.
One opportunity he exploited was what is known as thekimchi premium. While Bitcoin was pricing at around $10,000 in the US, it traded for $15,000 on Korean exchanges. This was because of a huge demand for Bitcoin in Korea, Bankman-Fried said.
Around its peak, there was a vast spread of around 50%, he said. However, because the Korean won is a regulated currency, it was difficult to scale this arbitrage. Bankman-Fried said:
“Many found a way to do it for small size. Very, very hard to do it for big size, even though there are billions of dollars a day volume trading in it because you couldn’t offload the Korean won easily for non-crypto.”
Although nowhere near as significant, the premium still exists today. According to CryptoQuant, the premium is listed at 18%.
Bankman-Fried then sought a similar opportunity in other markets, which he found in Japan. He said:
“It wasn’t trading quite the same premium. But it was trading at a 15% premium or so at the peak, instead of 50%.”
After buying Bitcoin for $10,000 in the US, investors could send it to a Japanese exchange. There they could sell it for $11,500 worth of Japanese yen. At that point, they could convert the amount back to dollars.
Because of the trade’s global nature and the wire transfers involved, it would take up to a day to perform. ”But it was doable, and you could scale it, making literally 10% per weekday, which is just absolutely insane,” Bankman-Fried said.
Bankman-Fried was successful where others were not because he managed to facilitate all the different components involved in the trade. For example, finding the right platform to buy Bitcoin at scale, then getting approval to use Japanese exchanges and accounts. There was also the difficulty of even getting millions of dollars out of Japan and into the US every day.
“You do have to put together this incredibly sophisticated global corporate framework in order to be able to actually do this trade,” Bankman-Fried said. “That’s the real task, the real hard part.”
The decentralized aspect of the crypto ecosystem enables these large arbitrage premiums to exist. With other financial markets, there is a cross merging between exchanges and central clearing firms or brokers, Bankman-Fried explained. “So it’s really capital-intensive, and also you have to worry about counterparty risk,” he added.
But once investors and traders come to understand the crypto space intimately, they can figure out where the counterparty risk is close to zero, but the edge is still high.
According to Bankman-Fried:

2021-04-09 15:00:56+00:00,"Apple claims websites can replace iOS apps, but cant name a single developer that has done it successfully",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-claims-websites-replace-ios-150056281.html,The Independent,"(Photo by James Yarema on Unsplash) Apple has claimed that web applications accessed through its browser are comparable in quality to downloading apps from its App Store . This is despite technical limitations, an inability to cite a single developer  who had substituted a native app for a web app successfully, and having conducted no studies into the matter. The apparent contradiction comes in filings for an antitrust case in Australia , and recent court documents submitted as part of Apples dispute with Fortnite developer Epic Games . Apple and Google have 40 per cent and 60 per cent of the global smartphone market, respectively; yet because iOS apps do not work on Android, and visa-versa, the Australian government is examining whether there is adequate competition for the smartphone giant. In its defence, Apple made the case that: Web browsers are used not only as a distribution portal, but also as platforms themselves, hosting progressive web applications (PWAs) that eliminate the need to download a developers app through the App Store (or other means) at all. Progressive web applications are websites that cache information on the smartphone; they can have an app icon on the home screen, can work offline, support push notifications, and can load faster than the browser. Web apps are becoming increasingly popular, Apple continued. Amazon, for example, has just launched its Luna mobile gaming service as a web app. Microsoft and Google are also launching gaming apps on iOS via web apps. The developer of the Telegram messaging app has also recently stated that it is working on a rich web app for iOS devices. However, as revealed by court documents in Epic Games case , Apple has apparently not performed any studies or analysis that have examine[d] potential performance differences between web apps and native apps. This is possibly due to the restrictions that web apps have versus native apps, those downloaded through Apples App Store. Web apps can only access 50MB of cache memory, and browsers have limited access to APIs. Story continues Epic Games filings state that the ability to create and directly distribute web apps does not lead developers to opt out of distributing native apps through the App Store, with Ron Okamoto, Apples VP of Developer Relations, unable to name a single developer that withdrew an app from the App Store because the developer could substitute to distributing a web app. Pavel Durov, the founder of Telegram, has also criticised Apple for its ability to completely restrict which apps you use , despite Apple citing the service as an example of competitive practices. Telegrams rich web app, which would run via Safari on iOS, works almost as smoothly as the native app but is still not the same thing and is meant to work only in extreme cases if for any reasons, Durov continued. Amazons Luna and Microsofts xCloud are also prohibited from the App Store, due to Apples rules that prevent separate app store options on iOS . These rules do not exist on Android, where smartphone manufactures like Samsung and Huawei operate their own app stores. In response, Apple pointed out that Fortnite would be available through streaming on Nvidia GeForce Now, providing an alternative means for Epic to reach all of the iOS consumers that it could otherwise reach through the App Store. For this case, the issue of app store payments remains a key issue between Apple and Epic Games, with Apple banning Fortnite from iPhones and iPads after Epic attempted to circumvent the smartphone companys in-app payment system  which takes a 30 per cent cut of any purchase made. In response many third-part developers, including Spotify and Protonmail , have claimed that Apple has near total control over the mobile ecosystem and what apps consumers get to use  with no oversight, regulation, or fair competition. Epic Games customers, Apple argues, would be able to make purchases via Safari or another platform like a PC and then use the in-game items on their iPhone  and as such are not limited by App Store restrictions.

Brandt identified a pattern in XRP’s weekly price chart that he described as a “possible inverted head-and-shoulders with a stunted right shoulder.” XRP has quadrupled this year in price and recently climbed above $1 for the first time since 2018, for a $37 billion market capitalization.
The pattern “would indicate prices a boatload higher” to new all-time highs, Brandt, CEO of Factor LLC,tweetedFriday.

Inverted head-and-shoulders patterns comprise three price troughs, with the middle one being the lowest, and a trendline connecting the high points of the two retracements. A breakout or bullish reversal is confirmed once an asset establishes a firm foothold above the neckline hurdle.
While XRP has already flipped the neckline hurdle of 75 cents into support, a weekly close above (Sunday, 23:59 UTC) is still needed to confirm the breakout.
That would open the doors for a rally to $3.30, the all-time high hit on Jan. 4, 2018, according to data source Messari.
Technical analysis is subjective because there is an art to the science involved in identifying patterns. Hence, sometimes analysts differ on the validity of patterns or interpret similar-looking price structures differently.

According to Katie Stockton, a technical analyst at Fairlead Strategies, the price structure seen on the weekly chart is not a textbook inverted head-and-shoulders formation.
“It does not meet my qualifier of having just three major oversold lows throughout the formation of the pattern,” Stockton said in an email. “There is such a thing as a complex head-and-shoulders, but I think more accurately this can be labeled as a rounded base.”
For an inverted head-and-shoulders pattern to be valid per Stockton, the three troughs need to be accompanied by an oversold reading on an overbought/oversold indicator such as the relative strength index (RSI).
Brandt and Katie differ on semantics but agree on the interpretation. “The takeaway is similarly bullish given the breakout above long-term resistance,” Stockton said, adding that XRP has already achieved the upside price targets.
XRP is currently trading at $1.003, representing a 58% gain for the week – the most since the final week of January, according toCoinDesk 20data.

2021-04-09 15:16:26+00:00,Visa and PayPal Can Be the Cosmos and Polkadot of CBDCs,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-paypal-cosmos-polkadot-cbdcs-151626153.html,CoinDesk,"Just over a week ago, one action by payment giants Visa and PayPal moved cryptocurrencies out of a mere “speculative asset” zone into clear “currency” realm. While much has been said about this development, the future potential of these players is even more significant in the central bank digital currency (CBDC) world than with cryptocurrencies.
When Bitcoin was launched, no cryptocurrency project focused deeply on interoperability. Fast forward 12 years and a vast array of interoperability plays have developed – Cosmos, Polkadot, Chainlink and others. Similarly, CBDCs are at their nascent phase currently, with very few live projects and pilots. Fast forward a few years and interoperability is poised to become perhaps the most major bottleneck for CBDCs.
With the coronavirus pandemic pushing the use of contactless payments, central banks all over the world are rushing to experiment with CBDCs. The domestic capabilities required for CBDCs are already complex, but globally bridging the gap between various CBDC initiatives and existing financial infrastructure is a mammoth challenge.

CDBCs will need to share compatible technology, code languages, and standards, to achieve full functionality. Standardizing legislative structures, harmonizing regulatory discrepancies between jurisdictions, and ensuring CBDC’s legal tender status is another major dimension of interoperability challenge.
Recentresearchby the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) and other bodies proposes various models such as a multi-CBDC bridge between different central banks using wholesale CBDCs. A common theme in central bank experiments involves the use of “corridor” networks for real-time, cross-border settlement between CBDC transactions.
One conclusion has been that there is a requirement for a modern SWIFT-like system – a consensus process by a third-party mediator between two distinct CBDCs that can verify cross-chain transactions, ensuring transaction information is compatible with data on both sides of the transfer. This will ensure that state transfer laws, such as anti-money laundering (AML) regulations, are followed while avoiding the problem of double-spending. CBDCs may require a common technical interface or even a shared clearing system between local systems. Enter payment players.

In the internet era, as businesses, merchants and governments moved to digital payments, Visa already cracked the infrastructure and interoperability requirements to process payments between them. Its flagship solution, VisaNet, interoperates between the layers of government in 200 countries, 15,000-plus financial institutions, 46 million-plus merchants and businesses and over 3 billion card holders.
Today it is the world’slargestelectronic payment network, with robust capabilities in both domestic processing as well as cross-border processing. All of these become essential when it comes to the CBDC landscape.
PayPal is a different sort of payment company but in its own way performs an interoperability function. While Visa is primarily a payments processor, PayPal runs one of the world’s largest e-commerce payments networks with over377 millionactive users and merchants. With a focus on online and mobile payment wallets for consumers, it is offering more products and an omni-channel experience. PayPal acts as a gateway for a variety of merchants and payment processors to plug in, including card players such as Visa and Mastercard. In recent years PayPal has also been focused on creating interoperability among digital wallets, physical stores, online stores and other products such as discount finders.
CBDC interoperability is a harder challenge to solve than blockchain interoperability because it requires tackling both complex engineering and complex regulations. Apart from adoption, speed and scale, the real advantage for these players is not their systems, but that they are legally-compliant in every jurisdiction they operate in. This already gives them a near Herculean advantage compared to blockchain players when it comes to the realm of CBDCs. And they are actively capitalizing on it.
Most major payment players are actively innovating for the CBDC and digital currency space. For example, Mastercard recently launched a proprietaryvirtual testing environmentfor evaluating CBDCs, which has already aided a number of banks in their evaluation and exploration of national digital currencies.
The new platform will enable banks, financial service providers and consumers to simulate the issuance, delivery and exchange of CBDCs. Central banks, commercial banks, technology and consulting firms have been invited to assess CBDC tech designs, validate use cases and assess interoperability with existing payment rails. Although there are a number of possible operational models, the most common one involves central banks issuing and distributing digital currencies, through commercial banks and other approved payment providers.
CBDC interoperability … requires tackling both complex engineering and complex regulations.
Additionally, users of a multi-currency Mastercard debit card will be able to purchase, carry, swap and sell up to eighteen conventional and digital currencies, as well as make free international ATM withdrawals up to a certain number.
Visa has already built and launched its solution to settleUSDCtransactions on Visa cards on the Ethereum blockchain. Its pilot allowed Crypto.com to settle a portion of its obligations for the Crypto.com Visa card program in USDC. This was enabled by Anchorage, the first federally chartered digital asset bank and an exclusive Visa digital currency settlement partner. These exact capabilities and their treasury improvements and integration with Anchorage will help with CBDC processing in the future.
PayPal enabled payments barely a week ago withbitcoin,ether,bitcoin cashandlitecoinin their digital wallets. Its cryptocurrency offering last year enabled customers to convert their cryptocurrency holdings into fiat currency at checkouts. If a user has “sufficient cryptocurrency balance to support a qualified transaction,” the crypto-payment function would automatically appear in their PayPal wallet. Although PayPal has not made public its CBDC strategy as yet, it is actively working on the space with an in-house team.
As CBDCs emerge as a major disruptor to existing infrastructure, interoperability remains one of the most significant roadblocks to their functionality. Although most financial institutions remained wary of digital currencies, payment players like Visa, Mastercard and PayPal have not only accepted the concept of cryptocurrencies and CBDCs but are constantly innovating on both fronts. The future could see them carving out a new niche for themselves – as the interoperability layer for the upcoming CBDC world.

According to a report by local media outletTencent Newson Thursday, Chief Marketing Officer Gao Ziyang allegedly attempted to short the state’sbitcoinlast year.
The funds were in the company’s care after police had seized them in a separate incident. Beosin was charged with holding and converting the bitcoin to fiat on behalf of the Chinese treasury where Gao had access.

Rather than sell the funds, it is alleged the executive tried to short the seized bitcoin in August using excessive leverage. At the time, bitcoin was trading between $10,500 and $12,500 before rising to new heights above $20,000 four months later. The erroneous short position ended up liquidating approximately 300 million yuan (US$45.7 million) worth of bitcoin.
The court file released only the last name of the suspect. The company has denied Gao’s involvement in the case and has not confirmed his detainment, according to the report. However, the company’s CMO can not be reached and his name has been removed from the company’s official website after the report.

2021-04-09 16:30:54+00:00,Smart Contracts Could Elevate Cardano to a Top Tier Cryptocurrency,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smart-contracts-could-elevate-cardano-163054660.html,InvestorPlace,"Cryptocurrency has been booming over the past six months, and that’s allowed a lot of seemingly left-for-deal alt-coins to come back to life. For example, takeCardano(CCC:ADA-USD).
Source: Shutterstock
ADA’s price fell as much as 98% from its 2017 peak to its ultimate trough. However, Cardano improbably came back and is now as valuable as ever.
Charles Hoskinson founded the Cardano platform in 2015 and it officially launched in 2017. Hoskinson, for those unfamiliar, was initially a co-founder ofEthereum(CCC:ETH-USD).
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
However, he left Ethereum over strategic differences with Vitalik Buterin and launched his own project, Cardano, which he felt would be able to improve upon Ethereum’s framework in several key ways.
• 7 Great Stocks to Buy Under $10
While Hoskinson targeted a few important elements such as better energy efficiency and lower transaction fees, Cardano hasn’t really taken off.
Yes, Cardano’s market capitalization briefly spiked from $600 million to $10 billion in 2017, but the price of ADA went into a long slumber since then. Until 2021, that is. This year Cardano’s price has reached its old highs from 2017. Here’s why.
One of the biggest trends right now is non-fungible tokens (NFTs). These are being compared to digital art.
A creator can put some piece of intellectual property — a tweet, .jpg file, meme, video, or other such thing into a digital token. Then, using the NFT architecture, the unique rights to that property can be auctioned.
While you can obviously reproduce copies of things infinitely on the internet, the NFT secures actual digital ownership of the original content for whoever buys the asset.
Cardano has enjoyedsome trading buzzthanks to NFTs. Hoskinson has been appealing to NFT platforms to consider using Cardano instead of Ethereum for handling these transactions.
That makes sense in theory given the high transaction costs on Ethereum right now. Still, it’s far from certain if Cardano will pick up much NFT business and if NFTs themselves will be a lasting investment category.
NFTs are fun and may boost Cardano’s price for a bit. Like many other crypto memes, however, NFTs may end up gone before long. Does anyone still rememberCryptoKitties?
No, the real driver for Cardano here is smart contracts. the company’s leadership has suggested that it will berolling out smart contractson its blockchain by early May. This is potentially the killer app that could elevate Cardano to the big leagues.
Ethereum has gained tremendously in stature since last year, as it has developed a decentralized finance “DeFi” ecosystem based around smart contracts. This allows a bunch of novel financial arrangements and legal contracts that can be operated seamlessly online.
Recent estimates suggest that Ethereum’s DeFi platform now holds around $40 billion in assets. Cardano hopes to grab a big chunk of that. Its different architecture will allow it to avoid the huge transaction fees that have hampered the adoption of Ethereum.
Hoskinson’s other claims, such as that Cardano is more energy-efficient than Ethereum, could make a big difference if Cardano catches up to Ethereum in terms of its main features.
Out of the second-tier of cryptocurrencies, Cardano is one of the better options. It’s certainly ahead of other currently popular altcoins such asRipple(CCC:XRP-USD) orDogecoin(CCC:DOGE-USD).
Cardano has a well-known founder, an active development roadmap and a number of potentially valuable features. Skeptics will argue that there’s a bit of a speculative element to Cardano, particularly since many r/WallStreetBets folks gravitated to ADA.
However, that’s true of many altcoins lately, and Cardano is far from the most touted of the bunch.
Over time, there still hasn’t been much to demonstrate that Cardano will overtake Bitcoin or Ethereum in importance. And, at least so far, the crypto market has largely rewarded the biggest coins rather than the upstarts. However, the launch of Cardano smart contracts could change things.
If you want to diversify a little outside of the big two, ADA isn’t a bad option.

2021-04-09 16:33:58+00:00,"As Coinbase Listing Nears, Analysts Pitch Valuations From $19B to $230B",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coinbase-listing-nears-analysts-pitch-163358121.html,CoinDesk,"In a sign of the extreme range of opinions on cryptocurrencies, not to mention the uncertainty and risk of investing in the 12-year-old industry, analysts are estimating values for next week’s Coinbase stock listing at anywhere from $230 billion to one-twelfth that amount.
New Constructs, an investment research firm, estimates the U.S. cryptocurrency exchange’s valuation should be closer to $18.9 billion. Delphi Digital, a digital asset research firm, calculates a Coinbase valuation between $160 billion and $230 billion if the stock can command above-average price multiples. Earlier this week, the brokerage firmDA Davidsonestimated the market cap at $90 billion.
Coinbase’s direct listing will trade on the Nasdaq exchange under the ticker COIN on April 14, and the event is increasingly seen as a watershed moment for the fast-moving industry.
Related:Stellar Foundation Implements Protocol Upgrade Following Node Outage
One crypto exchange,FTX, has even tried to capitalize on the speculative fervor around the Coinbase stock debut by listing a “pre-IPO contract” designed to allow market participants to bet on the initial share price. It’s up about 16% for the month to date to a value of $499, implying a valuation of around $103 billion, assuming an estimated 266.2 million shares outstanding.
• “The price of COIN will fluctuate greatly depending on forward guidance and growth expectations as well as the valuation multiple it winds up commanding,” Delphi Digital wrote.
• The research firm also stated that “it’s not implausible that the stock could trade closer to 15-20 times forward sales, which would imply a roughly $172 billion-$230 billion total market value.”
• Maintaining high valuations will depend on Coinbase’s ability to attract millions of new users. Verified users grew 23% between 2018 and 2019 and another 34% between 2019 and 2020, reaching 43 million in Q4 of last year, according to Delphi. (That verified user count jumped to56 millionat the end of March 2021, according to Coinbase’s earnings call on April 6.)
• Growth in new users contributes to margin growth and overall profitability. Coinbase estimates $1.8 billion in total revenue for Q1 2021 on $335 billion in trading volume, theexchange said Tuesday.
• However, Delphi cautioned that COIN could be subject to market risk, especially if growth stocks continue to struggle relative to value peers. “Valuations for growth stocks are trading at significant premiums relative to historical averages,” writes Kevin Kelly, partner at Delphi.
According to the New Constructs report, however, Coinbase “has little-to-no-chance of meeting the future profit expectations that are baked into its ridiculously high expected valuation of $100 billion.”
• “The crypto markets are very young and we expect many more companies to compete for the profits Coinbase enjoys today. As the cryptocurrency market matures, we expect Coinbase’s transaction margins to drop precipitously.”
• “The ‘race to the bottom’ phenomenon that took place in late 2019 with stock trading fees will likely make its way to the crypto trading space. We expect Coinbase competitors to cut their trading fees to zero in an effort to increase market share.
• “Competitors such as Gemini, Bitstamp, Kraken, Binance and others will likely offer lower or zero trading fees as a strategy to take market share, which would start the same ‘race to the bottom’ that we saw with stock-trading fees in late 2019. Similarly, if traditional brokerages begin offering the ability to trade cryptocurrencies, they will most certainly cut down on the unnaturally wide spreads in the immature cryptocurrency market.”
According to New Constructs, Coinbase would need to produce compounded annual revenue growth of 50% over the next seven years. Yet, Nasdaq’s greatest 10-year revenue growth rate was just 21%.
Assuming a rate of 21% and slight profit-margin compression, COIN shares would be worth just $18.9 billion, the report argues.

2021-04-09 17:36:08+00:00,Best Bitcoin Trading Platforms in 2021,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-bitcoin-trading-platforms-2021-173608583.html,SmartAsset,"Bitcoinwill likely go down as one of history’s great examples of financial FOMO (fear of missing out). Not long ago early adopters literally couldn’t give this asset away, and now a single token costs almost as much as a small house. Certainly there is a world of regretful investors out there who, 10 years ago, had the chance to spend (literally) a few dollars on Bitcoin and laughed. That doesn’t mean that all digital tokens are a good investment. It doesn’t even mean that Bitcoin always is. This inexplicably valuable asset is also historically volatile, making it an interesting but by no means secure addition to your portfolio.
However, it does mean that investors across the market have begun taking digital assets seriously. How can they not? At time of writinga single Bitcoincost more than $57,630. That’s a kind of value that the market simply can’t ignore. From brand-new traders to stodgy investment banks, the market has noticed Bitcoin and its associated products.
The question is, if you’re interested in trading them, where should you go?
Afinancial advisorcan give you invaluable guidance on investing in cryptocurrencies, including which platforms are most appropriate for you.
What Is Bitcoin? What About Blockchain?
As a threshold matter it’s important to distinguish Bitcoinfrom blockchain. While fully exploring the issue is beyond the scope of this article, in a nutshell what you need to know is this:
• Bitcoin is a digital asset that’s built using a database format known as “blockchain.” This is a way of storing data that lets you publicly and securely establish individual ownership over a specific file. While you can still copy a given file endlessly, that ownership will travel with every copy you make.
• This type of digital asset has many different names, such as “token” and “cryptocurrency.” While Bitcoin is by far the most valuable cryptocurrency on the market, there are hundreds of different types of blockchain assets that people buy, sell and invest in.
• Cryptocurrency is a fast growing but highly unstable market. This is common among emerging assets. The blockchain coding format on which cryptocurrency is based is still new and cryptocurrency still hasn’t found its use case. It’s likely that prices will stabilize eventually as investors and entrepreneurs determine how to approach this asset, but that will take time.
This is important to understand because when we talkabout Bitcointrading platforms we’re not talking about just Bitcoin. Some investors will be interested in the one, headline asset. When others say “Bitcoin” they really mean blockchain assets in general.
Whichever you’re looking to trade, these are some of the best platforms on which to do it.
Best Overall: CoinbasePros
Coinbase is one of the most well-known cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, and one of the most popular. There are a lot of good reasons for this.
Perhaps the best part of Coinbase is the platform’s design.Cryptocurrencyis a complicated field, one dominated by niche experts. This makes it even more important that your trading platform makes sense. And Coinbase is a well-designed, intuitive trading platform that helps users navigate the tricky world of crypto trading.
But that doesn’t mean that Coinbase leaves the sophisticated investor behind. In particular, Coinbase pro boasts the second-highest volume of cryptocurrency trading on the market at time of writing. Robust research tools allow you to understand the state of the market (withan emphasis on volatility, which is critical in this sector), while investors can find all of the major cryptocurrencies on the market. In other words, this is a platform that’s easy to jump into and with all the tools for a true professional.
Cons
Coinbase has a Byzantine fee structure that can be difficult to understand. The price you pay changes based on the size of each transaction, the nature of your account, how you’re paying and even where you’re located.These fees can be on the high side, but exactly how much you’ll pay is a quickly moving target.
At the same time, Coinbase sometimes receives criticism for its range of offerings. This is a mixed issue. On the one hand, there are thousands of crypocurrencies in the marketplace at large and, at time of writing, Coinbase only offers 53 to trade. On the other hand, while Coinbase does offer only a fraction of the market overall, it focuses on the best and most stable cryptocurrencies you can trade. There’s a good reason to see this as a well-curated market rather than a limited one.
Best Large Volume: BinancePros
By volume there is little comparison.Binance conducts the second-highest volume of tradesin the entire cryptocurrency market. This is absolutely critical in the decentralized cryptocurrency market, which has no clearinghouse to set universal prices. The high volume of trading on Binance help ensure that its transactions move efficiently and its prices accurately reflect the market at large.
At the same time this exchange also offers one of the broadest selections of cryptocurrencies available for trade. At time of writing Binance offered 347 different coins, giving it the ninth-broadest selection of any platform. While this means that Binance will have options that are less trustworthy than a more curated platform, it also means that you have a better chance of finding new opportunities.
Finally, Binance offers a strong fee schedule. While it is not the cheapest on the market,it does offer very competitive commissions.
Cons
Perhaps the biggest drawback to Binance is that itdoes not accept U.S. currency. This is a common problem among cryptocurrency exchanges, particularly the large ones that are likely to trade in products that have either avoided or failed SEC scrutiny. While this doesn’t necessarily block Americans from the exchange altogether, it does mean that you will either have to trade exclusively in cryptocurrency or use the platform’s more limited U.S.-oriented site.
Binance is also clearly designed for more sophisticated users. While the interface is well laid out, it is not as intuitive as other platforms out there. Beginners will likely want to avoid Binance.
Best For Stability: GeminiPros
One of the biggest debates in cryptocurrency has been whether or notthese assets count as securitiesfor the purposes of SEC regulation. This is an area where, to be fair, cryptocurrency companies have not helped themselves. This industry tries to have it both ways. Firms that deal in blockchain issue their coins on open markets, literally calling the release of a new productinitial coin offerings, while at the same time arguing that this is a piece of software no more subject to SEC oversight than a copy of Angry Birds.
This debate has very real consequences. Many exchanges can’t operate with U.S. dollars, and many cryptocurrency products struggle to find legitimacy with mainstream investors.
Gemini was founded to avoid all of that. This platform emphasizes regulatory compliance. It behaves and governs itself like a bank, working from within established U.S. laws and looking for products it can sell on that basis. The platform isFDIC insured, and investors can feel confident that their money is in hands that meet the same financial oversight as an E*TRADE or a TD Bank. In an industry where many exchanges have folded due to criminal activity or simple carelessness, there is enormous value to that.
Cons
Gemini’s cold storage securitymakes the platform far more secure than many other exchanges, but also slows down some transaction times. This is a tradeoff, not necessarily a bad thing, but it’s one to consider. Finding cryptocurrency assets that meet the strict financial guidelines of U.S. oversight is not necessarily easy, and as a result Gemini tends to be one of the smaller exchanges on the market. It has fewer than 40 cryptocurrencies to trade at time of writing, and its trading volume is literally an order of magnitude smaller than its major competitors. That, potentially, can affect liquidity.
Best For Learning: EtoroPros
Etoro is a stable, very well regarded cryptocurrency platform. It offers all of the most popular cryptocurrencies (as judged by volume of trading). This service is known as exceptionally secure, is available to U.S. traders and even charges very competitive fees. While pricing is a moving target for this marketplace, expect to pay a spread of approximately 0.75% to 3% on each trade. All of this makes Etoro a solid platform. Where it shines is in its networked trading tools.
In addition to paper trading, in which users can create a demo account and test out various trading strategies, Etoro provides users with what it calls “social trading.” This set of tools allows you to study and track the portfolios of other investors. You can see how they are currently trading, and use this information to learn the market without staking your own money until you feel ready. For investors that want to take this even further, Etoro allows you tocopy trade. With this feature you can actually set your portfolio to mimic the trades made by someone else. While of limited value to experienced investors, this overall design makes Etoro an outstanding choice for investors just learning the market.
Cons
Etoro is not a strong choice for sophisticated investors.
Outside of its social trading tools, this is a solid investment platform that does generally well across the board. But it doesn’t particularly shine in any one area. Etoro has all of the most popular cryptocurrencies, but an otherwise limited list. It has a solid set of research tools, but nothing particularly in-depth or innovative. It is a good platform, but if you are trading at a high level you can probably do better.
The Bottom Line
If you want to trade cryptocurrency at a high level, or overall, start with Coinbase. Investors looking for a breadth of options should check out Binance’s vast marketplace, while those who value legal and financial stability will do well at Gemini. Finally, if this is your first time trading cryptocurrency, Etoro will be a great place to get started.

The article, “The bitcoin terrorists of Idlib are learning new tricks,” written byCoinDesk alumnaRachel-Rose O’Leary, examined how Syria-based jihadi are using encrypted tools like cryptocurrencies and Telegram to further their cause. This isn’t a new trend. What’s different is, with increased surveillance of their operations, there’s less open discussion about crypto among terrorists. They’re going further underground.

Bitcoin’s strength comes from being an open-access tool. Anyone, anywhere can transfer BTC to anyone, anywhere. Its emergence was a revolutionary moment in the history of money. It prevents governments and private companies from meddling in the basic human need to transact. Humanitarians, laypeople and criminals alike benefit.
“Bitcoin’s non-discriminatory nature should be celebrated,” Gladstein said. His main issue with the article, primarily its headline, is that by focusing on the criminal application of Bitcoin, Wired is providing yet another reason for governments to attempt to stymie adoption.
Gladstein thinks in this instance the data in O’Leary’s article doesn’t support a sensationalist headline – he did the math, and the “bitcoin terrorists” only transacted about $10,000 in BTC two years ago. But it’s also indicative of a general anti-Bitcoin stance in the mainstream press.
His criticism is context-dependent. Of the 18 articles Wired UK has published on Bitcoin, almost all – except for a glowing profile of the Winklevoss twins – were “negative,” by his reckoning. This is all the more relevant given “the significant history of using terrorism as a pretext for cracking down on civil liberties.” Just recently, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen called the illicit use of cryptocurrencies a “growing problem.”

All this may be true, but it may miss the larger story of what Bitcoin means for the world. It also over-emphasizes the power of the media to shape reality in the year 2021, especially the reality about Bitcoin, which famously doesn’t care what people think it is or isn’t.
In a phone call yesterday, Gladstein made reference to a media establishment that largely ignores how Bitcoin is being used as a means of emancipation by those who were born under the yoke of authoritarianism. There is a clear anti-Bitcoin bias in the mainstream press, he said.
I am doubtful that an article, or even the entire media establishment, could harm Bitcoin adoption. The media is simultaneously over- and- undervalued. Overvalued, precisely because of the control some think it exerts in influencing – rather than simply reflecting – public opinion. Undervalued because, well, the collapse of the industry speaks for itself.
The first time I heard about bitcoin on Reddit I thought it was cool, downloaded the source code to mine some, never did and then forgot about it. The first time I bought bitcoin was to purchase a grey-area good on the clearnet. When my unspent UTXOs started rising in value, I took a closer look. It wasn’t until I read an article in New York Times Magazine that I fully understood what was going on.
I’d wager there are many adoption stories like mine. As Gladstein noted, the majority of Bitcoin’s users “aren’t on Twitter,” even fewer read Wired. Adoption comes from utility. People stay either because they can make money, or they become ideologically aligned. From Turkey to Morocco, across Latin America, Asia and Africa, real people are finding value in crypto. These stories are told in numerous publications,notleastofallinCoinDesk.
The same attributes that make Bitcoin a tool for fostering self-reliance also provide a boon for criminals and despots. North Korea has a sanctions-busting crypto stockpile. And, yes, Al Qaeda, ISIS and Hamas have taken advantage of direct, unstoppable and irreversible payments. There must be a reason why “RC” (research chemicals) sites offer discounts on purchases made through cryptocurrency.
O’Leary noted in her article that only a small fraction of crypto payments are for criminal activity, citing Chainalysis research. But the criminals are here, and to say otherwise is to obfuscate the power of Bitcoin.
“Bitcoin doesn’t care what you write about it. Bitcoin is unstoppable,” Gladstein said. Negative articles “damage people’s ability to use it, it scares them away – whether they are in advanced economies or in places like Syria.”
It’s possible that when Bitcoin was young, less known and less accepted these negative portrayals might have sunk the project. Satoshi thought WikiLeaks would draw regulatory attention. But now, Bitcoin has a patina of respectability. Publicly traded firms are buying BTC, insurance companies are betting on it and some of the most influential people are singing its praises.
As much as external criticism won’t bring the network down, there is an internal series of conflicts among bitcoiners that could harm it. Gatekeepers, so-called “maximalists” and those who chill criticism have done their damage. I know smart people who turn away from BTC after being dragged on Twitter.
If greater adoption is the aim, then we might as well tell the truth about what that world would look like. Thewholetruth. “Uncensorability” means more freedom — and more terror. That’s the point.
That may be a world many would prefer not to live in. O’Leary showed, to some extent, that world is already here.

2021-04-09 18:18:00+00:00,This stimulus check advice from Suze Orman seems to have caught on,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/suze-orman-said-keep-stimulus-120000687.html,Moneywise,"More than 150 million American households have now received their third stimulus check.
The $1,400 payments, which are part of President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion relief bill, are expected to help recipients cover immediate household expenses andpay down debt.
But another prediction — that the new round of stimulus would flow into trendy ""meme"" investments like GameStop and Tesla stock and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin — hasn't quite materialized.
In a client memo released in late March, JPMorgan reported that while many people had used their stimulus checks to invest, the investments weren't as trendy — or as risky — as in last December and January. This time, much less stimulus money has gone crypto, tech stocks and high-risk options.
And that suits personal finance superstar Suze Orman just fine.
Orman, one of America's most prominent personal finance experts, has in recent weeks shared some strong opinions about how you shouldnotspend your windfall.
“Don’t you dare use it to invest in the stock market,” she said in a video about stimulus checks recorded in late March for CNBC.
Here's her take on the role the market should play in your stimulus strategy, plus some other advice for how to use your $1,400 checks.
It’s not so much that investing is a bad idea in general. But pouring your entire $1,400 stimulus into meme stocks like GameStop is what concerns Orman most. Investing shouldn’t be a game, she says — it should be a well-thought-out strategic component of your personal finances.
Instead of taking cues from the internet, once you’ve already set aside what you need for savings and retirement, pick an investing option that allows you to build a balanced portfolio that will grow steadily and reliably over time.
These days, such a portfolio is easily achieved. A DIY investing app canautomatically invest your spare changeand keep your money growing without your having to take a big swing at a trendy stock or cryptocurrency.
Some companies are even allowing accredited investors toinvest in U.S. farmland.
As with any product, though, it's important to research the investing platforms you're considering and toread the reviews.
After a full year into the pandemic, Orman recognizes you may be keen to use your stimulus funds to pay off some of your outstanding balances.
But, she says, that would be a mistake — especially if you’re still looking for work.
“Do not rush, especially if you do not have a job yet and everything isn’t going the way you want it to be, do not rush to take that money and pay off your credit cards.”
If your bills are piling up and expensive interest is adding to your troubles, a better option would be toget a lower-interest debt consolidation loanto help you better manage what you owe —andpay it off sooner.
Before the pandemic hit, Orman had long counselled her followers to build up emergency funds for at least eight months.
Other finance experts had suggested that was more than necessary and three or six months was all you’d need.
“What happened last year? Three months would have gone in three months,” Orman says. “And then what would you have done? Now it has come to pass that eight months wasn’t even enough.”
Because of the pandemic, Orman now recommends having at least 12 months socked away in an emergency fund.
“I don’t think you can have too much of an emergency fund,” she adds.
Taking some of your stimulus money and putting it into your emergency fund is Orman’s top suggestion.
But make sure your cash isn’t going to just sit in your bank, working for someone else. Ahigh-yield savings accountcan help your emergency savings grow on its own.
Not all bills have the same priority status. Orman cautions against taking all of your stimulus money to pay down your credit card or car or even to catch up on your rent: “Don’t do it. You’re going to be very sorry.”
“The key to your freedom is having that security, that emergency fund. Keep it right there and do not spend it.”
Her advice is to continue to pay the minimum on all of your bills and play it safe until you’re gainfully employed again. Or at least until things in your life are back to normal, financially speaking.
If you can, shop around for better rates on recurring expenses like your auto insurance bill — you couldsave up to $1,100 a yearby comparing rates. That way you’ll be able to hold onto more money without having to give up all of your stimulus.
We might be dealing with a prolonged crisis right now, but it will eventually end. If you have the bandwidth to think a bit about the future right now, you won’t regret it.
If your health insurance has lapsed during the pandemic, now’s the time toshop around for an affordable planbefore the current open Obamacare enrollment period closes Aug. 15. New subsidies introduced by the Biden administration will save Obamacare policyholders $600 a year, on average.
Looking further down the road, if you can spare some of your $1,400 check, putting it towards retirement is a great idea. If you haven’t alreadyset up a retirement account, the sooner you do, the sweeter your golden years will be.
Orman’s overall message in theCNBC interviewwas to make your stimulus check last as long as possible.
There’s no guarantee we’ll get a fourth check so if your household already has or is set to get a check, stretch those dollars as far as you can.
If you didn’t get a check this time or maybe the money doesn’t look like it will last as long as you like, you have some options.
You could trim your budget to ""make your own"" stimulus check.
For example, maybe it’s time to permanently log off any streaming services or other monthly subscriptions you’re not actively using.
Or do you have a hobby or special talent? Turn it into aside hustle to bring in extra income.

Loeb’s Third Point LLC now holds cryptocurrency from five of its funds with Coinbase, according to regulatorydocumentsobtainedby CoinDesk. Some tout billions of dollars in underlying assets, but it is not clear how much of that is in crypto, which assets, or for how long they’ve invested.
With less than a week to go before Coinbase’s Nasdaq debut, the custody tie-up underscores how Brian Armstrong’s nine-year-old firm has transformed itself from abitcoin-only digital wallet into a massive vault for Wall Street’s crypto bets.

Coinbaserevealedit held $122 billion in institutional assets during this week’s voluntary earnings call. It expects “meaningful growth” driven in part by custody revenue in the year ahead.
CoinDesk reported earlier this week that fellow hedge fund titanPaul Tudor Jonesis also a Coinbase client, offering a glimpse at the deep-pocketed investors behind the exchange’s institutional assets under management.
Third Point did not respond to CoinDesk by press time.
The hedge fund’s true exposure to crypto assets remains more opaque. In a brochure accompanying the March 31 filings, Third Point said it can invest directly in cryptos or indirectly through derivatives contracts.

Notably, it is open to staking and lending any cryptos as well, the documents say.
“This is the first big traditional hedge fund that I know of that is doing staking,” said Tim Ogilvie, who runs a company called Staked that provides staking services to institutional investors, after reviewing the documents.
“On the one hand I’m surprised. On the other hand I’m not surprised,” he added. “If you want to hold a crypto asset that is proof-of-stake I think you have a fiduciary responsibility to stake.”
Proof-of-stake blockchains like Tezos, Cosmos, Solana and others reward token holders with payouts akin to interest for securing the network with their contributed holdings.
Institutional investors are slowly waking up to staking, Ogilvie said. With staking there are two gains generators: the token price and the staking payout. It’s a guaranteed reward on top of a speculative bet. Ogilvie said there are $4.5 billion in crypto assets on Staked.
Loeb has never publicly disclosed his crypto holdings. But he began to toy – at least publicly – with the asset class in an early-March tweet.
Third Point’s own foray into crypto likely started well before. In mid-March the asset manager revealed it is backing crypto exchange eToro, which, like Coinbase, is gearing up for a Nasdaq debut.
eToro’s SPAC deal (it is going public through a merger with FinTech Acquisition Corp. V, or FTCV) gave Third Point and Loeb an opportunity to invest.
They did: Loeb now holds 3 million shares, or more than 10%, of FTCV, worth nearly $43 million on Friday, according tofilings.
UPDATE (April 9, 21:05 UTC):Loeb appeared to confirm that he holds crypto ina tweetciting this story after publication.

2021-04-09 19:30:28+00:00,5 Most Notable Events in the DeFi Space,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-most-notable-events-defi-193028615.html,BeInCrypto,"As the crypto world recovers from NFT-mania, the decentralized finance (DeFi) space is gaining traction once more, ready to re-occupy its positions as prince of the crypto-space. BeInCrypto explores 5 notable invents that have been pivotal for the DeFi space.
Launched in 2018, Uniswap (UNI) is a decentralized exchange (DEX). It’s built on the Ethereum (ETH) network, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency project by market capitalization. As a result, Uniswap is one of the most prominent DeFi projects.
It aims to offer cryptocurrency users a means to exchange their holdings without the need for a centralized party to administer transactions. Uniswap completely disrupted the cryptocurrency exchange space, traditionally controlled by centralized exchanges (CEXs) such as Binance.
In fact, in February this year, Uniswap became the first decentralized exchange to process over $100 billion worth of transactions, whilst alsoleading developmentin the DEX space.
Its native token, UNI, also reflects the impact the leading DEX has had on the DeFi space, with a market capitalization ofjust under $15.5 billionat press time.
This makes it the ninth most valuable cryptocurrency project in the market.
Uniswap spurred on a wave of development in the DEX space, leading that space to be valued in the tens of billions of dollars.
One of the most notable (and possibly the most direct) developments triggered by Uniswap is SushiSwap (SUSHI), a competing project in the DEX world. In fact, SushiSwap isa fork of Uniswap, led by a community that opposed the latter’s engagement with the centralized venture capitalist world.
SushiSwapbecame a formidable competitorto its parent chain after initially attracting liquidity away from Uniswap. It then developed several products and relationships that cemented its status as a worthy operator in the DeFi space.
Today, SUSHI is the fifth largest DEX by market share, with the platform’s market capitalization sitting at $2.1 billion.
Whilst DEXs run the DeFi economy, it’s products that characterize the DeFi space. And no other platform can boast the clout of Andre Cronje’s Yearn Finance (YFI).
Yearn Finance developed an easy way for budding “DeFi-ers” to interact with DeFi products. But it alsointroducedthe concept of “fair launches” to the space.
At the Token Generation Event (TGE), all YFI tokens were made available to anybody who participated. None of these are reserved for developers or early investors.
Smart contracts drive most DeFi applications and platforms. Most of them sit on the Ethereum blockchain.
Indeed, without smart contracts, there would be no DeFi at all. However, and possibly contrary to popular belief, smart contracts pre-date Ethereum by nearly two decades.
In 1996, the legendary Nick Szaboproposedsmart contracts to execute a pre-defined set of instructions.
In 2012 Vitalik Buterin applied the concept to Bitcoin’s blockchain, creating Ethereum.
And finally, where would the entire space be without Bitcoin itself. Whilst many look to the “Summer of DeFi” in 2020 for the DeFi space’s genesis, in reality, Bitcoin is the original DeFi product.
In the now-infamous Bitcoinwhitepaper, Satoshi Nakamoto wrote that Bitcoin’s blockchain was:
“A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”
Accordingly, Bitcoin was bid as an alternative and decentralized payments service, a service that is key to the finance industry. Today, however, Bitcoin has become a store of value rarely used for its decentralized payment capabilities.
And sitting at$58,416.81 at press time, it is likely to stay that way!",4,0.9,"The article highlights positive developments and growth in the DeFi space, indicating a bullish sentiment.",2,0.7,"The article highlights the growth and innovation in the DeFi space, which, while positive, could lead to increased volatility and competition, posing moderate risks to Bitcoin and the broader crypto market."
2021-04-09 20:03:08+00:00,Here's Why Semiconductor ETFs Are Looking Attractive for Q2,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-semiconductor-etfs-looking-200308178.html,Zacks,"The semiconductor market is experiencing expanding demand with increasing digitization and growing dependency on the Internet owing to some new normal trends like online shopping, work from home, digital payments, digitization of healthcare, growing favor for video gaming and many more.
Moving on, growing automotive sales are also driving semiconductor demand due to the increasing utilization of chips in electronic components of vehicles. Robust demand for electric vehicles (EVs) and plug-in hybrids also deserve a mention here. Markedly, EVs require complex electronic systems composed of advanced semiconductors. Furthermore, the increased deployment of 5G technology — the next-generation wireless revolution — is likely to support growth.
According to the latest data from the Semiconductor Industry Association (or SIA), global semiconductor sales rose to $39.6 billion in February, jumping 14.7% on a year-over-year basis, per a Design And Reuse article. However, it declined a nominal 1% from January’s total of $40 billion. Regionally, year-over-year sales rose across all major markets. Sales in Asia Pacific/All Other grew 18.2%, while in China it jumped 18.9%, followed by 9.7% in Americas, 7.6% in Japan and 6.8% in Europe. On a month-over-month basis, sales increased 0.8% in Europe and 1.5% in Asia Pacific/All Other.
In this regard, John Neuffer, SIA president and CEO, said that “global semiconductor sales during the first two months of the year have outpaced sales from early in 2020, when the pandemic began to spread in parts of the world. Sales into the China market saw the largest year-to-year growth, largely because sales there were down substantially early last year,” as stated in a Design And Reuse article.
It is worth noting here that strong adoption of gaming, wearables, drones and VR/AR devices is fuelling significant growth in the semiconductor arena. Moreover, growing adoption of cloud computing and the ongoing infusion of AI, machine learning and IoT are expected to keep the sector brewing with opportunities in 2021.
Furthermore, the coronavirus-induced work-from-home and web-based learning trends have spurred demand for chips from PC manufacturers and data-center operators. Data-center operators have increased their capacities to meet the surging demand for cloud services. The companies that provide design and other components for chip making are expected to gain from this trend.
Going on, the increasing importance of Hybrid cloud among enterprises is attracting investments from large public cloud providers, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, International Business Machines and Oracle. The data-center chip providers will likely gain from this trend.
An accelerated coronavirus vaccine rollout, introduction of another round of fiscal stimulus and the reopening of U.S. economy may lead to faster U.S. economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic-led economic slowdown.
Encouragingly, President Joe Biden aims to distribute 200 million coronavirus vaccines within his first 100 days since joining office, per a CNBC article.
Moving on, on Mar 31, Biden unveiled his $2.3-trillion infrastructure development plan that focuses on improving American infrastructure. The proposal includes around $50 billion for the American semiconductor industry in an attempt to address the worldwide shortage of chips, per the verified sources. The plan also sets aside an amount of $174 billion to boost the EV market.
According to  World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS) data, the global semiconductor market is now projected to rise 8.4% in 2021, based on double-digit growth of memory and optoelectronics. The forecast for 2021 is higher than the previously-projected growth of 6.2%, made by the WSTS in July.

Bitcoin’s struggle to retest a key resistance level at $60,000 has “dampened” market sentiment, said Hunain Naseer, senior editor at OKEx Insights.
“Until bitcoin breaks $60,000 and consolidates above it, we are likely to continue seeing traders buy weakness and sell on strength instead of holding assets for longer periods and waiting for a bigger move,” Naseer told CoinDesk.
While bitcoin may have failed to break above $60,000 a few times, it has nonetheless found strong support at the $55,000 price level the past week.

The investment theme for former Instinet CEO Atkin and his two Communitas co-founders – Tom Glocer, former CEO of Reuters, and Duncan Niederauer, former CEO of the New York Stock Exchange – is building market infrastructure. In other words, providing the picks and shovels that, bit by bit, shift the paradigm.
Following this theme has led these three on a journey that has included early-stage backing of soon-to-list cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase to recent investments in hot tickets like zero-knowledge proofs company StarkWare and back-end provider Alchemy.

“I’d call our thesis ‘pattern recognition,’” said Atkin, the driving force behind Instinet’s dominance in electronic trading in the late 1990s that led to the firm’s$464 million initial public offering. He also ran Majestic Research, an early pioneer in using big data to provide key insights to the world’s largest asset managers.
Similar patterns that existed in the transformation of equities markets are repeating for cryptocurrency. On the other hand, because crypto began with retail investors (rather than evolving from institutional to retail like traditional markets), this has led to fragmentation and many trading venues. What’s at stake right now for crypto are things like getting abitcoinexchange-traded fund (EFT) over the line in the U.S.
“The decentralization of markets is good”, said Atkin, “but you need software in the middle to bring all these exchanges and marketplaces together.”
It’s really about what crypto needs to become a true asset class, and that’s infrastructure, said Glocer.

“That means things like real end-of-day data, sound asset management strategies, ways to keep things safe and in custody. So all the things that you needed in the equities markets,” Glocer said.
Founded three years ago, Communitas Capital was the formalization of what Atkin, Glocer and Niederauer had been doing informally together for years. The hat was passed around, $20 million was raised and now the firm has made 17 investments. Communitas is now about to go out and raise its second fund.
It’s very natural in Silicon Valley history to only talk about how brilliant you are with the good ones. Back up the truck, and you’ll see all the other ones that I thought were really smart and have blown up.
The firm’s more recent investments, following once again the need-for-infrastructure thesis, are right at the intersection of decentralized finance (DeFi) and the currently exploding non-fungible token (NFT) craze.
“Alchemy is kind of like DevOps for DeFi and NFT developers,” said Glocer. “The guys really impressed me. It was a bit like when I met up with the Coinbase team. The Alchemy guys were in their 20s and seemed to have half of Stanford investing.”
Prior to the launch of Communitas, when Glocer was starting out as an angel investor, he was lucky enough to join Coinbase’s2015 Series C.
“I was introduced to the Coinbase founders, who were thinking early-on about issues I care about such as market structure and price transparency. I was so impressed I asked if they would make an allocation available for me. And that’s how Coinbase happened,” Glocer said.
Thanks in no small part to the current crypto bull charge, shares in Coinbase are expected to list at around $350 apiece, catapulting the exchange into the $100 billion ranks of big-ticket IPOs like Airbnb and Uber.
Glocer, who also joined early rounds for LendingClub and TransferWise, remains humble about his fortuitously timed investments, however.
“I think it’s very natural in Silicon Valley history to only talk about how brilliant you are with the good ones,” said Glocer. “Back up the truck, and you’ll see all the other ones that I thought were really smart and have blown up.”

Changing history aside, a traditionalgrowth investormight have bought the leading work-from-home tech stocks.

The results would have looked quite reasonable. The top-five holdings of theDirexion Work From Home ETF(NYSEARCA:WFH) — which include fast-growing names likeBox.com(NYSE:BOX) andFacebook(NASDAQ:FB) — would have turned $10,000 into $13,900 today, outperforming theS&P 500by a 50% margin.
But they would have missed out.
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Had the same investor bought five of the topRedditstocks,* they would have turned the same $10,000 into $263,000. Those who bought options or sold at peaks would have earned even more. Yet, many of these Reddit darlings — a ragtag group of dying video-game retailers, speculative cryptocurrency miners and money-losing automakers — are the opposite of what a reasonable investor might have considered at the time.
The stocks came to dominate for one straightforward reason:the rise of retail investors. These newer investors have turbocharged momentum investing in an extraordinary way. Not only has the momentum effect eclipsed other factors (growth, valuation, product quality and so on). The“Reddit Effect”now means that younger investors have an outsized influence over which stocks win.
• 7 Great Stocks to Buy Under $10
As more young people become investors, their effect will become more pronounced and potentially turn into a “Mementum” effect instead. So, rather than ignoring the chatter on social media sites like Reddit andDiscord, here’s how to understand — and perhaps profit from — the rise of the retail investor.
At first glance, predicting retail investors might seem impossible. These younger buyers tend to move quickly “from one hot theme to the next,”according to analysis by Vanda Research.
Last summer, for instance, young investors piled on the “high-growth” bandwagon, snapping up companies likeNio(NYSE:NIO) andSnowflake(NYSE:SNOW) with better growth stories than actual revenues. As fall approached, these traders turned to “election stocks,” such as clean energy and marijuana — sending firms likePlug Power(NASDAQ:PLUG) up 350%. It didn’t matter that many of these companies were unprofitable. In some cases, some were even losing customers. These newer investors didn’t seem to care.
And then cameGameStop(NYSE:GME) — the ultimate show of retail investor force.
On Jan. 19, famed short-seller Andrew Left of Citron Researchtweeted a $20 price targeton GameStop stock. The call wasn’t particularly controversial by Wall Street standards — GME was trading at $17 only two weeks earlier. But Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets users quickly took the stock to nearly $500 within two weeks.
The diversity of hot themes might seem impossible to predict. Industry outlook doesn’t seem to matter — Reddit favoritesTesla(NASDAQ:TSLA) andPalantir(NYSE:PLTR) both operate in fast-growing industries, while mall retailerExpress(NYSE:EXPR) works in a shrinking one. Trading styles don’t seem important either — young investors seem to like highly indebted moonshots such asAMC Entertainment(NYSE:AMC) andHertz(OTCMKTS:HTZGQ) as much as flush-with-cashRoblox(NYSE:RBLX). To an outsider, the inconsistency of investment style might seem comical.
But there’s one theme that ties every hot investment theme together: momentum.
Though most young investors don’t realize it, every top Reddit stock fad so far has been built on rising stock prices. High-growth stocks like Nio only became widely popular last summer, after they had already risen 250% or more. The same pattern holds for airline stocks, clean energy, cryptocurrencies and GameStop. Though early movers make the most significant profits, most retail investors buy in onlyafter seeing recent gains.
Much of this behavior has to do with a hunger for gains. The medianRobinhoodinvestor has just$240 in their account.The College Investorfounder Robert Farrington estimates that the average 31-year-old has only$2,032 in net worth.
That means younger investors willfavor moonshot betsover slow-growing winners. When you have almost nothing to lose, a YOLO (you-only-live-once) approach becomes the most logical investment strategy.
But some of momentum’s popularity also has to do with the Reddit echo chamber. Social media has made it far easier for like-minded investors to crowd into popular trades. Outlets from Reddit to Discord now have forums dedicated to individual assets. Smaller firms likeSOS Ltd(NYSE:SOS), a Chinese cryptocurrency-mining company, boastthousands of dedicated followerswho will come to a stock’s rescue the momentshort-sellers warn of fraud.
Traditional investors have long known the slight advantage that momentum-based portfolios create. A study by fund manager James O’Shaughnessyfound that since 1951, the 50 best large-cap relative strength stocks have outperformed the 50 worst by 5.6% annually. Adding small and mid-caps boosts that figure to 8.5%. In other words, a portfolio invested in a momentum strategy since 1951 would have grown 60 times larger by the study’s 2003 endpoint.
Retail investors, however, have turned this slow-moving trend into a rocket ship.
Imagine we completely ignored our time traveler from before. Instead of worrying about Covid-19, we had bought the five best-performing S&P 500 stocks of the prior year — a group that included household names likeTarget(NYSE:TGT) andChipotle(NYSE:CMG). How would we have done?
The answer: we would have returned 85%, more than doubling the return of the top work-from-home stocks and tripling the S&P 500 return.
The pattern features even more prominently among smaller-cap stocks. In the past year alone, theInvesco S&P SmallCap Momentum ETF(NYSEARCA:XSMO) has outperformed its large-cap sibling, theInvesco S&P 500 Momentum ETF(NYSEARCA:SPMO), by astaggering 24 percentage points. Investors didn’t even need to check a Reddit message board.
So, how can investors identify the next top Reddit stock before they do? It’s not as easy as buying the top-returning stocks on Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets and assuming a +1,000% return is next.
Instead, investors need to consider three factors essential to “Mementum” investing.
1. Timing.Reddit’s concept of momentum can be quite short — having only one to three months of outperformance seems to be enough for retail investors to jump on a new trend. Airline stocks in May 2020 are a prime example of a short window.
2. Company size.The typical stock mentioned on Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets has a median size of $5.3 billion, compared to the S&P 500’s $29.9 billion. GameStop was only a $2.5 billion firm when Citron’s Andrew Left sent Reddit on its mission to send GME to the moon.
3. Leverage.Virtually all hot Reddit trends have either high operating or financial leverage. Cryptocurrency-mining companies like SOS andMarathon Patent Group(NASDAQ:MARA), for instance, trade more likeBitcoin(CCC:BTC-USD) options thanks to their high fixed costs.
Having all three elements won’t guarantee landing the next Reddit bonanza. But these guidelines provide a stunningly powerful early warning signal.
ConsiderSundial(NASDAQ:SNDL), a firm that would have turned a $1,000 investment in November 2020 into $23,300 three months later. Shares of the near-bankrupt firm initially spiked 300% after anti-marijuana Republicans lost Senate control in the 2020 election, a logical outcome for an uncertain election. But then things took a turn toward the sublime. Two weeks after the decisive Georgia runoffs, Reddit usersstarted jumping on board. Five days later, the stock would get squeezed“to the moon.”
In October 2019, traditional brokerages slashed their commissions to compete with a new existential threat: zero-fee trading on Robinhood, an upstart mobile stock app. Never mind that much of Robinhood’s fees are hidden by “payment for order flow” mischief; younger investors only noticed their trading fees drop from$4.95to $0.
For older investors, the change barely registered. Several hundred commission dollars look minuscule when transacting million-dollar portfolios. But for younger traders just starting, zero-fee trading was a game changer. Today, retail investors trade almost as much volume asmutual funds and hedge funds combined.
That makes some unlikely candidates potentially big future winners. ConsiderBabcock & Wilcox(NYSE:BW), a legacy nuclear player that now focuses on biomass and other renewable energy. Its modest $747 million market capitalization and 1% operating margin, combined with a stunning 149% year-to-date return, makes it an ideal Reddit target. Investors should pay close attention if “BW stock” starts showing up on social media platforms. Retailers likeConn’s(NASDAQ:CONN) and aircraft leasers likeFly Leasing(NYSE:FLY) fall into the same list of stocks to watch..
Many academics dismiss momentum effects. In their minds, market efficienciesprevent positive risk-adjusted returns.
But successful investors have long known the power of buying winning companies like Amazon andNetflix(NASDAQ:NFLX). Now, investors need to adjust their strategy to accommodate the new Reddit paradigm. It’s going to be a challenging but profitable journey for those who do.
* The five Reddit investments would have included GameStop, Tesla, Marathon Blockchain, Dogecoin and Bitcoin. WFH stocks include Facebook, Box, Fortinet, Netapp and Cisco. Holding period from 12/31/2019 through 4/9/2021.

Significantly, the developer said he willaccept Bitcoin as rent or lease paymentsfor both residential and retail tenants.
See:Big Landlords Are Seeing Record Profits During the PandemicFind:4 Best Places to Buy and Sell Cryptocurrency
The L.A. Times speculates that billionaire Elon Musk could be one of Caruso’s first Bitcoin tenants, as he leases space for a Tesla showroom at Caruso Properties’ Americana at Brand in Glendale, Calif. Caruso told the Times that he hadn’t spoken to the Tesla CEO about paying rent in Bitcoin yet, but Caruso said, “He may be the first.”
In February, Musk invested $1.5 billion of Tesla’s funds in Bitcoin and, in late March, he announced that customers could purchase a Tesla with Bitcoin.
However, accepting payments in the form of a currency that experts at Bloomberg predict could rise to more than seven times its current value in the next year makes financial sense. Using that same currency to make purchases, especially on something other than tangible goods, could result in a financial loss, especially if the U.S. starts to see inflation rise as many predict.

Caruso told the L.A. Times he hasn’t seen “a clamor” from tenants to pay rent in Bitcoin, and the asset may remain more desirable as an investment than a currency for the time being.
Still, as Caruso joins Musk as one of the world’s billionaires putting faith — and funds — into Bitcoin, which was trading at more than $56,000 at the end of the day on Wednesday, the crypto could be on its way to gaining even more legitimacy as a currency. In recent months, financial juggernauts such as Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan began exploring the possibility of recognizing Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class.
Caruso’s Bitcoin investment comes as part of a partnership with Gemini, the L.A. Times reports.The cryptocurrency exchange was founded by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, best known for suing Mark Zuckerberg for allegedly stealing their social network idea in college.

WisdomTreefirst filedfor this ETF last month, but haspreviously attemptedto launch a regulated financial product with exposure to cryptocurrencies.
A bitcoin ETF would provide retail and institutional investors a chance to invest in a regulated financial product incorporating the world’s oldest cryptocurrency, without requiring them to invest in the crypto directly. This is seen asa potentially safer wayto gain exposure to the still-young crypto sector, which can be volatile or frothy at times.

The regulator’s initial decision on whether to approve or reject, or otherwise continue evaluating VanEck’s application is expected to come next month.
Also on Friday, Kryptoin Investment Advisors, an asset manager launched by Jason Toussaint of SPDR Gold Shares fame,filed a registration formfor a bitcoin ETF, bringing the total number of active applications to eight.

2021-04-09 21:45:05+00:00,Signal Founder May Have Been More Than a Tech Adviser to MobileCoin,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/signal-founder-may-more-tech-214505106.html,CoinDesk,"• Signalrecently launched a beta integrationof MobileCoin (MOB) for payments. Its price has jumped from $7 to over $55 in the past month.
• Signal founder Moxie Marlinspike, whom MobileCoin previously described as a technical adviser, may have been more deeply involved in the cryptocurrency project.
• An earlier, nearly identical white paper found online, which MobileCoin CEO Joshua Goldbard called “erroneous,” lists Marlinspike as the project’s original CTO.
The founder and CEO of encrypted messaging app Signal, Moxie Marlinspike may have been the former CTO of MobileCoin, a cryptocurrency that Signal recently integrated for in-app payments, early versions ofMobileCoin technical documentssuggest.
MobileCoin CEO Joshua Goldbard told CoinDesk this 2017 white paper is “not something [he] or anyone at MobileCoin wrote,” though it is very nearly a verbatim precursor toMobileCoin’s current white paper. Additionally,snapshotsof MobileCoin’s homepage from Dec. 18, 2017, until April 2018, list Marlinspike as one of three members of “The Team,” though his title is not given there. He is not listed as an adviser until May 2018.
The team for the self-described privacy coin has always acknowledged Marlinspike as an adviser to the project, but neither the team nor Marlinspike has ever disclosed direct involvement through an in-house role, much less one so involved as Chief Technical Officer.

If Marlinspike actually was involved as a CTO in MobileCoin’s early days, the recent Signal integration raises questions of MobileCoin’s motivation for associating itself with the renowned cryptographer, along with his own motive for aligning with the project, given the MOB team has historically downplayed this involvement.
“Signal sold out their user base by creating and marketing a cryptocurrency based solely on their ability to sell the future tokens to a captive audience,” said Bitcoin Core developer Matt Corallo, who also used to contribute to Signal’s open-source software.
Goldbard shared another document dated Nov. 13, 2017, same as the other white paper, which does not list a team for the project. He claimed that this white paper was the authentic one and the other was not.
“Moxie was never CTO. A white paper we never wrote was erroneously linked to in our new book, ‘The Mechanics of MobileCoin.’ That erroneous white paper listed Moxie as CTO and, again, we never wrote that paper and Moxie was never CTO,” Goldbard told CoinDesk.
Related:Lakers Asst. Coach: Financial Advisors Afraid of Telling Pro Athletes to Invest in Crypto
This book is actually the most recent “comprehensive, conceptual (and technical) exploration of the cryptocurrency MobileCoin” posted on the MobileCoin Foundation GitHub, which Goldbard describes as project’s “source of truth” and serves as the most up-to-date technical documentation for the project.
This ”real” version of the paper is nearly identical to the “erroneous” white paper except there is no mention of team members or MobileCoin’s pre-sale details. (Both white papers and current MobileCoin technical documents are embedded at the end of this article for reference.)
Goldbard said the “erroneous” white paper was accidentally added as a footnote to thislatest collection of technical documents compiled by Koe, a pseudonymous cryptographer who recently joined MobileCoin’s team. That footnote also lists Marlinspike as a co-author of the paper along with Goldbard.
“He just googled it, like everyone on the internet seems to be doing today, and put [it in] as a footnote. It was an oversight. I did not notice it in my review of the book prior to publishing,” Goldbard told CoinDesk.
A metadata analysis of the papers run by CoinDesk shows that the “erroneous” paper was generated on Dec. 9, 2017, while the “real” paper was generated two days later.
Marlinspike declined to comment on the record about his professional relationship with MobileCoin.
In a December 2017 Wiredarticletitled “The Creator of Signal Has a Plan to Fix Cryptocurrency,” Marlinspike went on the record as a “technical adviser,” a title CoinDesk has also used to describe his relationship with MobileCoin in the past.
“There are lots of potential applications for MobileCoin, but Goldbard and Marlinspike envision it first as an integration in chat apps like Signal or WhatsApp,” the article reads.
It also states that “Marlinspike firstexperimented with[Software Guard Extensions (SGX)] for Signal.” These special (andexpensive) Intel SGX chips create a “secure enclave” within a device to protect software, and MobileCoin validators require them to function (validators,as in other permissioned databases, are chosen by the foundation behind MobileCoin).
In the 2017 white paper that Goldbard disavows, Marlinspike is listed under the “team” section as CTO, with experience including being “the lead developer of Open Whisper Systems, [meaning] Moxie is responsible for the entirety of Signal,” which had just over 10 million users at the time. This same white paper describes MobileCoin’s Goldbard as a “high school dropout who thinks deeply about narratives and information systems.”
Signal’s code has historically been open source,though this changedabout a year ago; code for the MobileCoin integration was added in Signal’s last beta. The nonprofit, which has five full-time employees, subsists largely on donations andhas no clear revenue model, though Whatsapp co-founder Brian Actoninjected $50 millioninto the app in 2018.A 2018 tax filingshows revenue of just over $600,000 for the fiscal year and over $100,000,000 in assets and $105,000,000 in liabilities.
The disavowed white paper also shows details of MobileCoin’s proposed distribution, which the paper says included selling 37.5 million MOB tokens (out of a 250 million supply) in a private presale at a price of $0.80 each for a total of $30 million.
Indeed, in the spring of 2018, MOB raised $30 million from crypto exchange Binance and others in such a private presale, TechCrunch’s Taylor Hatmakerreported. Goldbard referred to the TechCrunch article when discussing MobileCoin’s financing with CoinDesk.
In a MobileCoin forum on Jan. 8,one user asked for detailsabout MOB’s circulating supply.
“Supply: 250mill MOB; Circulating supply: impossible to know (‘circulating’ is pretty hard to define anyway),” Koe responded. MobileCoin does not currently have online tools such as a blockchain explorer to search the network for data.
One user chimed in to say that because all 250 million MOB were generated from a “premine,” or creation of maximum supply before launch, there’s no way for users to earn them through staking or mining.
“I suppose you could request donations,” Koe replied.
Perhaps summing up the sense of betrayal the Signal community feels, one post simply reads, ‘Et tu, Signal?’
MobileCoin’s consensus model copies Stellar’s, meaning only MobileCoin Foundation-approved nodes, which must run on a machine that uses the aforementioned Intel SGX chips, can partake in consensus. The white paper makes no references to rewards or payouts to validators from MOB supply.
MobileCoin Token Services, an affiliate of the MobileCoin Foundation, is currentlyselling MOB(presumably the remaining coins that did not sell in the presale) to non-U.S. investors by taking orders over email.
MOB, for now,trades on FTX  andBitfinex, two popular crypto exchanges, and a few smaller venues.
When the coin began trading in January, it first listed for around $5. Now, it’s worth about $55 (which, assuming a supply of 250 million MOB, gives the coin roughly the same market cap as Chainlink or Litecoin, the 10th and 9th most value cryptoassets by market cap). The coin clocked over $15 million in volume over the past 24 hours between FTX and Bitfinex,according to exchange data.
Speaking to the coin’s design, the founder of privacy coinmonero, Richard Spagni,claimedthat MobileCoin uses the privacy building blocks of his project’s source code for its own design without giving credit.
Something of a legend in cryptography circles, Marlinspike began working on Signal in 2014 after founding Open Whisper Systems in 2013. Before this, he served as Twitter’s head of security after his 2010 startup, Whisper Systems, was acquired by the social network in 2011.
His only on-the-record professional relationship with MobileCoin comes from his technical advisory role, which he took on in late 2017 at the height of bitcoin’s last bull market and its accompanying initial coin offering bubble.
Reporting on the project in 2019, the New York Times’ Nathaniel Popper and Mike Isaacoriginallywrote that “Signal … has its own coin in the works” before amending the article to clarify that “MobileCoin will work with Signal, but it is being developed independently of Signal.” The correction seems to typify the shifting narrative of Marlinspike’s and MOB’s relationship across various records. (Wired’s 2017 coverage, for example, says that “The Creator of Signal Has a Plan to Fix Cryptocurrency.”)
“I think usability is the biggest challenge with cryptocurrency today,” Marlinspike told Wired in the December 2017 article. “The innovations I want to see are ones that make cryptocurrency deployable in normal environments, without sacrificing the properties that distinguish cryptocurrency from existing payment mechanisms.”
Signal’s own users are less convinced.
The app’sReddit pageis plastered with submissions complaining about the decision to add MOB, with many confused as to why Signal would integrate a coin in the first place, let alone one that isn’t very well known (and which only went live this year).
“Using your messenger service to sit on the blockchain hype for no good reason, bloat a clean messenger app and introduce privacy concerns was more than unnecessary,” one postreads.
Perhaps summing up the sense of betrayal the Signal community feels, one post simply reads, “Et tuSignal?”
Speaking on Moxie’s involvement and the app’s decision to add MOB, Anderson Kill partner Stephen Palley said, “I can’t speak to the discrepancy between investor materials and what you’re being told, but I don’t necessarily judge them for wanting to make a buck after years of providing great open-source software basically for free.”
Other messaging apps like Telegram and Kik have tried and failed to launch in-app cryptocurrency payments by rolling their own coins. Both attempts were promptly quashed by regulators. Encrypted messaging appKeybase was the first messaging app to add cryptocurrency paymentswhen it integrated Stellar’sXLMin 2018.
Given Facebook’s ownership of WhatsApp, its involvement in the Libra coin project (now known as Diem) may be seen as a similar attempt.
Oddly, Signal’s addition of MobileCoin is the first instance of a messaging app actually pulling off a crypto integration.
The question now is how many of Signal’s 50 million users, many of whom aren’t crypto enthusiasts, will use it.

2021-04-09 21:50:11+00:00,"Is Coinbase the Next Netflix, or a Blockbuster Video-in-Waiting?",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coinbase-next-netflix-blockbuster-video-215011966.html,CoinDesk,"It’s an irony not lost on anyone: The biggest company in the Bitcoin business is … a trusted middleman.
The leading U.S. crypto exchange, Coinbase, is on the brink ofa direct listingfor shares in the company on Nasdaq, opening it up to scrutiny in the public equity market and demonstrating the extraordinary demand for cryptocurrency. Its staggeringfirst-quarter resultshave all but guaranteed this stock market debut will be one for the history books, with analysts estimating the company’s value inthe tens to hundreds of billionsof dollars.
But how long can Coinbase thrive as more and more financial activity moves online natively? What happens to the original fiat-to-crypto on-ramp when people stop needing on- and off-ramps because all the money they earn, and all the places they spend it, are on the leaderless record-keeping systems known asblockchains?
Related:Bitcoin News Roundup for April 12, 2021
Such scenarios may sound fanciful at the moment, even to believers in the technology. But they are not out of the question.
“That bridging process is going to take decades,” Joey Krug, Augur founder and co-investment lead atPantera Capital, told CoinDesk in a phone call. And even when the process is complete, he still sees a role for intermediaries. “You can still do a lot and make a lot of money once everyone is in this new financial system.”
Opinions ranged widely about Coinbase’s long-term prospects as more internet users go native in a world of internet-native money. In what follows, we explore an array of views about how the company would fare in a far-off future of increasingly digitized value.
The current favorite example for a company the world passed by is Blockbuster Video. Once a great chain of VHS tape and then DVD rental stores, its fall came quickly as Netflix made watching movies on the internet easy (one store remains).

It’s not like video didn’t exist online before.BitTorrent was aliveand well and widely used by young people and internet hardcores, but it made most normies nervous.
Meanwhile, Netflix already had a relationship with millions of movie fans via its mail-order DVD rentals. When its executives were confident it could make streaming video easy for anyone, it launched a service with one-click ease of play and without any piracy in 2007.
So which is Coinbase? Is it Blockbuster or has it been Netflix all along?
WhenCoinbase filed its prospectusto become a publicly traded company, it disclosed that it sawdecentralized finance (DeFi)asa potential threat. Not everyone believes the company really meant it (“risk factors” disclosures are often kitchen-sink, cover-your-behind affairs). But imagine a future in which people get paid in crypto and can pay bills like rent and utilities on a peer-to-peer basis. If that day comes, why would anyone even need an app like Coinbase to get them back to fiat?
Coinbase is at its core an exchange. It’s a place to buy and trade different cryptocurrencies. So the question is, could blockchain-native exchanges, so-calleddecentralized exchanges (DEXs), eventually take away much if not all of its business?
It won’t happen soon enough to prevent this listing from being a blowout, that’s for sure.
“Decentralized exchanges will definitely grow massively, but I believe they will co-exist with centralized exchanges as each has their benefits,” Linda Xie, managing director ofScalar Capitaland a Coinbase alum, told CoinDesk by email. “Not everyone can or wants to store their own private keys and many like that there is an entity that can be available and/or held legally accountable should any issues occur.”
Anderson Kill attorneyStephen Palleyagreed. “It’s more likely that Coinbase will provide integrations that will use DeFi products, or things like DeFi,” he said.
But Do Kwon, one of the founders of thestablecoin protocol Terra, looks farther down the road. He told CoinDesk via email:
“Coinbase prevails today on [user experience] and easy on-ramps for U.S. retail. Both will be commoditized in DeFi over time – open systems inspire and mobilize developers to tackle both problems aggressively in a way that a closed monopoly like Coinbase never can.”
Coinbase is, right now, very much a Web 2.0 approach to the decentralized internet of value. It’s mobile-first andcentralizes custodyof assets in a way its users trust.
This is not howbitcoinand subsequent cryptocurrencies areintended to workbut, as Krug pointed out, it takes a long time to make a change so massive. Coinbase is an initial compromise.
Can it adapt as this evolution gets really far along?
Joseph Kelly, co-founder of crypto lender and custody companyUnchained Capital, drew a different, even older comparison than Blockbuster and Netflx. “It’s a little like the Yahoo vs. Google dichotomy,” he told CoinDesk in a phone call.
This is ancient history to most, but the initial idea of Yahoo! in the far-gone days of the late 1990s, was to create a directory of the internet that looked much more like the yellow pages of a phone book, where every site would exist in some nested category.
Like: Entertainment/Movies/Action movies/’80s movies/Terminator FanFic.
It made sense at the time and it worked well enough that Yahoo became a big company, but it turned out that the internet was a much too fuzzy place. Google came along with a whole different framework to organize an expanding web, and Yahoo Search’s relevance was not long for the digital world. The company, Yahoo!, became a pile of cash that no one could figure out how to spend well.
It wassold for partsin 2017.
As more people become comfortable with storing the keys to their crypto wallets and establishing trust with code, can Coinbase adjust? “It doesn’t have that in its core DNA,” Kelly contended. He pointed out that Coinbase’s willingness to empower its users has beena longstanding questionin the company.
“We’ve been helping customers on an almost weekly basis who have coin on Coinbase adopt a more self-custody approach,” Kelly said. “It’s a weird political environment these days and they worry about things like censorship.”
The example Kelly gave: What if the U.S. Internal Revenue Service starts holding people’s crypto hostage as a way to get back taxes paid? (Coinbase has resistedthe agency’s subpoenas in the past, but there’s no guarantee it will always do so.)
Krug sees the same issue differently. “The DeFi protocols are going to remain decentralized but you’re going to have businesses build totally centralized services on top of them,” he said. “If Coinbase launches some portal to use certain DeFi apps, that instantly credentializes it.”
Just as any coin listed on Coinbaseshoots up in value, any dapp Coinbase finds trustworthy is likely to spike in usage. RIP: transaction fees.
Avalanchefounder and Cornell University computer science professor Emin Gün Sirer agreed. Coinbase makes crypto feel like investing the way people already understand it. “You cannot discount how important this function is to putting crypto into the wallets of the next hundred million users and beyond,” he wrote in an email. “That said, DeFi is maturing rapidly, and will continue to offer complementary solutions that give users maximum control.”
If Coinbase does become a biggateway to DeFi, it will be interesting to see how the teams behind these protocols react. We’ve already seen one wave of user regret fromrelying on custodied solutionsin DeFi. People who used user-friendly DeFi appDharmato accessUniswapmissed out onthe UNI airdrop(over $1,000 worth of free tokens), for example.
If crypto is money-native to the internet, using it with a nice user interface while borrowing a stranger’s identity (the exchange’s) will always be tourism. Anyone who visits blockchains often enough will want full citizenship eventually.
Another question is whether the online world of value and the analog world of fiat will remain distinct realms.
That hasn’t been true of the internet broadly. The distinction between “meatspace” and “cyberspace” has broken down very nearly completely. Exceptin extreme cases, online life is just life.
That said, most people spend most of their time on platforms (such as YouTube and Facebook) that present a unified structure atop the chaos of the world wide web.
Michael Egorov of Swiss Stake, the creator of theDEX for stablecoins, Curve, told CoinDesk in an email that he sees the centralized players shrinking merely to a place that people come in and out. “I actually subscribe to the view that centralized exchanges (especially when Ethereum scales) will slowly convert to the role of [mere] on/offramps,” he wrote.
Coming in and out of fiat is the right point, in Egorov’s opinion, for regulators to watch users, and Coinbasehas done wellwith securities and commodities regulators.
“Coinbase is the most ubiquitous crypto on-ramp in the market today,” Eva Beylin, of the decentralized web analytics firmGraph ProtocolandeGirl Capital, told CoinDesk via direct message. “I think it’s more likely that Coinbase will continue to dominate the on/off-ramp sector and begin competing with payment processors like Stripe or fiat clearinghouses, rather than Defi.”
But “being a fiat onramp is not an unfair advantage over time when regulation becomes clear and more friendly,”Primitive Ventures’ Dovey Wantold CoinDesk over email. And Kelley noted that there’smore competitionforthat businessallthe time, anyway.
That said, it could be enough that Coinbase just remains at the top of that particular game. Centralized finance (CeFi) still has the lead over DeFi in some areas. “CeFi is still generally better at capital efficiency, transaction speeds and guarantees, and typically, pricing,” saidAndy Bromberg, CEO of Eco,a crypto startup aiming to marry saving and spending.
Coinbase has not “moved fast and broken things.” It has played by Washington’s rules. So does that mean D.C. will be ableto pick winnersin the crypto industry?
“My hot take is that Coinbase’s future depends on the outcome of the various ongoing regulatory battles,” said Joel Monegro, a VC atPlaceholder. “More top-down regulatory controls will benefit Coinbase, fewer controls will benefit DeFi.”
Palley agreed that access to state-sanctioned payment rails is a powerful asset and will be for a long time.
“I would say the biggest threat to Coinbase is from banks not from DEXs, that’s my view,” Palley said. If banks start letting customers buy crypto fromwithin their checking accounts, there won’t even be a need for users to connect Coinbase to their bank. “Banks and bank charters may be the biggest threats to Coinbase,” Palley said.
Yet he was also willing to admit that it may just be that DeFi hasn’t evolved quite far enough yet. All bets are off if something mind-bending emerges. “It could be that we’re waiting for a killer app, but I don’t thinkSushior Uniswap – as cool as they are – are going to be able to break into a broader financial market,” Palley said.
But to Krug’s way of thinking, Coinbase may or may not be a Blockbuster Video, but he’s sure the big banks are. “You can’t take an old school company and switch it to a Silicon Valley style company,” Krug said. “I don’t think that’s a real risk.”
As big as Coinbase has gotten, it’s still nimbler than a bank, Krug said.
“It’s clear to me that crypto eats the banking world entirely, but it’s not clear what portion of crypto will be decentralized versus custodial. I expect a healthy mix,”Erik Voorhees, the founder of anothercrypto exchange, Shapeshift, told CoinDesk over email.
In fact, one of the most vocal proponents of DeFi expects Coinbase will be here for a long time. “Coinbase has done a fantastic job of expanding their lines of business,”Variant Fund’sSpencer Noon told CoinDesk. “It’s a real testament to that team not resting on its laurels.”
In particular, he pointed to the crypto custody business, which hardly existed when Coinbasestarted working on it. Many people said that this is key. It’s the top and bottom of the market Coinbase will serve forever: the nervous newbies of retail and the financial giants who don’t want to worry about technical details of crypto custody.
Still, Wan sees even that business getting chipped away. She noted that there was awithdrawal movementfrom centralized exchanges in China last year that was little noted in the West. She expects more of that to come. “I highly doubt how much bitcoin will be left in [Coinbase’s] reserve in a few years timeframe (like in the nexthalving). So if that reserve is drained, people will notice the importance of having their own bitcoin in [their] control,” Wan wrote.
Nevertheless, Uncorrelated Ventures partner and Bain Capital Ventures alum Salil Deshpande sees in Coinbase a company that will continue to profit on the footprint it established in this industry, even if the way it profits changes.
“Coinbase won’t go the way of Blockbuster Video; they’ll go the way of Schwab. Schwab used to charge $44 per trade in the 1980s. Now trades are free, and Schwab has successfully made a living as an asset gatherer,” he wrote. “Many institutions will find it comforting to deal with an old-school middleman like Coinbase to take care of complicated details.”
Coinbase may remain but DeFi will almost certainly always be there and that means Coinbase customers will have a place to go. The fact they can may be a more important check on crypto’s publicly listed behemoth than regulators will ever be.

Steering clear of the first major support level at $56,498, Bitcoin rallied to a late morning intraday high $58,777.0.
Falling short of the first major resistance level at $58,939, Bitcoin eased back to sub-$58,000 levels.
Finding late support, however, Bitcoin broke back through to $58,000 levels to end the day flat.
The near-term bullish trend remained intact in spite of the latest pullback. For the bears, Bitcoin would need to slide through the 62% FIB of $26,041 to form a near-term bearish trend.
Across the rest of the majors, it was a mixed day on Friday.
Binance CoinandBitcoin Cash SVrallied by 8.29% and by 8.85% to lead the way.Crypto.com Coin(+5.11%) also found support to buck the broader trend on the day.
It was a bearish day for the rest of the majors, however.
Chainlink(-3.65%) andRipple’s XRP(-3.66%) led the way down.
Cardano’s ADA(-1.45%),Ethereum(-0.73%), andLitecoin(-2.25%), and Polkadot (-1.41%) also struggled, however.

Bitcoin would need to move back through the pivot level at $58,245 to bring the first major resistance level at $58,777 into play.
Support from the broader market would be needed for Bitcoin to break out from $58,500 levels.
Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level and resistance at $59,000 would likely cap any upside.
In the event of an extended crypto rally, Bitcoin could test resistance at $60,000 before any pullback. The second major resistance level sits at $59,420.
Failure to move back through the $58,245 pivot would bring the first major support level at $57,602 into play.
Barring another extended sell-off on the day, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$57,000 levels. The second major support level at $57,070 should limit the downside.

In late February, Bitcoin saw a retreat to as low as $43,000 amid uncertainty in the traditional markets over stimulus expectations and their positive effects on US bond yields. The market value of all bitcoin in circulation hit $1trn for the first time earlier this year, data website CoinMarketCap revealed. In December it also soared past Visa ( V ) to make it the world’s largest financial service.

In February, Tesla invested $1.5bn in bitcoin, and said it may even start accepting it as payment for its products. The automotive company’s founder Elon Musk also commented that investing in Bitcoin is a “less dumb form of liquidity than cash.” “To be clear, I am not an investor, I am an engineer,” he said on Twitter. I don’t even own any publicly traded stock besides Tesla.” He added: “However, when fiat currency has negative real interest, only a fool wouldn’t look elsewhere.

Bitcoin and altcoins keep recording new highs with retail and institutional interest at peak level. The leading digital asset crossed $60,000 momentarily to form a new all-time high.
There have been several speculations regarding thenext destination. Many suggested that the markets were overbought already and was destined for a heavy correction. Several others argue that bitcoin is still very undervalued.
Certain metrics point to the latter, including the stock to flow model. As pointed out by the founder of the Chamber of Digital Commerce Perianne Boring, bitcoin may rise even further. The Stock to flow model estimates that the digital asset may reach $100,000 to $288,000, this year.Speaking on CNBC, Boring said:
“Stock to flow says bitcoin should be priced at $100,000 to $288,000 this year. We have 12 years of data on Stock to flow on bitcoin. If you measure with the U.S. dollar, stock to flow is 94% correlated.
When you use gold, stock to flow is 99% correlated. Stock to flow also says one bitcoin will be 10,000 ounces of gold in 2029. That’s what people mean when they say bitcoin is eating gold.”
Boring’s analysis is based on the Stock to Flow (S2F) model which evaluates the stock of a commodity against the flow of new production.
Bitcoin’s volatility has gradually declined over the past few months. JP Morgan analystsbelieve that this could facilitate adoptionin the banking sector. Following bitcoin’s surge to $60,000, a major retracement was expected, but the price has stabilized instead.
In the last seven days, bitcoin’s price has hovered between the $56,000 support and $60k resistance.

Ethereum has seen similar price movements in recent months to that of bitcoin. Major alts have appeared to move in unison with bitcoin. However the correlation between bitcoin and ethereum has seen ethereum’s price action mimic that of bitcoin.

Big things coming to ethereum
Ethereum 2.0staking continues to see an increase in the amount of ethereum being staked. Currently the amount of ethereum being staked is 3.45 million. The total value of ethereum currently being staked is well over $7.4 billion invalue. The upgrade to the network is set to offer increased transactions on the blockchain, while reducing the cost of gas fees on the network. Something that is currently holding back the project due to rising gas fees on decentralized exchanges.
Ethereum has also been boosted by therecent newsthat one of the largest multinational financial services companies in the world is using the network. Visa has begun setting transactions on its own network through ethereum-backed USD Coin. The news has seen an increase in popularity in ethereum price as global utilization starts becoming evident.
Ethereum could very likely see more upside in price as the market continues to see bullish sentiment. The total cryptomarket capitalizationhas also reached a new high of $2 trillion, while cryptocurrencies have seen a surge in prices too.

Following a strong start to the weekend for the cryptocurrency market, bitcoin has finally managed to climb back over$60,000. The increase in price may have many smiling. However short sellers have taken a major knock as liquidations continue to pile up.
Market strength on Saturday saw the top four cryptocurrencies all gain handsomely in price. Consequently the majority of liquidations over the course of the last 24 hours came from bitcoin, ethereum, binance coin, and XRP.
Bitcoin jumped 2.6% on the day, with XRP surging by more than 20%.
While bullish momentum has continued over the course of the last few weeks. Short sellers have been trying to time the top of the run through the use of margin trading. However Saturday was not to be as the price increases across the top four caused huge losses.
According toBybt, over $915 million in liquidations have occured in the space of 24 hours. With over 113,000 traders being liquidated. The largest liquidation saw a Bitcoin whale on BitMex lose $10 million.
Bitcoin liquidations accounted for just over half of the total. With ethereum claiming over $153 million in liquidations. Followed by XRP with just under $100 million. Binance Coin saw $40 million in losses.
The big day of liquidations comes just three days after Bitcoin dropped nearly 5% to touch $55,600. A whopping$1.7 billionin liquidations followed as bulls took a beating. However it appears traders have not learned their lesson as the extended liquidations across the market continue.

Instead, it’s based on blockchain technology, with Bitcoin being the most popular one. As digital money continues to gain traction on Wall Street, more and more options become available. There are currently more than 5,000 cryptocurrencies on the market.
While you can use cryptocurrency to make purchases, most people treat it as a long-term investment. However, investing in cryptocurrency can be risky if you don’t know where to begin. These are the top 10 cryptocurrencies that are most worthy of investment in 2021.
Run a quick online search and you’ll find dozens of recommendations for how to invest in cryptocurrency. In choosing the top 10 picks, the following factors were considered.
How long has the cryptocurrency been around? New cryptocurrencies aren’t immediately ruled out, but having historical data for comparison helps you see how a company has performed up until now.
How has the company performed during its years in business? If you see stability in prices, that’s a good sign. If you notice that the cryptocurrency is gaining traction and becoming more valuable with time, that’s even better.
Good To Know
How does the platform compare to others in terms of usability and security? The first thing you want to look for is the speed at which transactions occur. The network should be able to handle transaction traffic with ease.
You also want to make sure your investment is secure. Most cryptocurrencies useblockchain technology, making all transactions transparent and easy to track. Blockchain technology doesn’t necessarily make it harder for hackers to steal your cryptocurrency. It does make it easier to track your investment so it can be recovered instead of being lost following fraud.
How many people are investing in the cryptocurrency you’re considering? When you see a high level of adoption, that means the cryptocurrency has better liquidity. Trading, selling or spending will be easier in the future.

Bitcoinhas been around for the longest of any cryptocurrency. It’s easy to see why it’s the leader, with a price, market cap and volume that’s much higher than any other investment options. Even with thousands of other cryptocurrencies on the market, Bitcoin still represents 40% of the cryptocurrency market cap.
Many businesses already accept Bitcoin as payment, which makes this cryptocurrency a smart investment. Visa transacts with Bitcoin, andTeslaCEO Elon Musk recently invested $1.5 billion in it. Plus, thelarger banksare beginning to incorporate Bitcoin transactions into their offerings, too.
The value of Bitcoin tends to fluctuate a lot. You may see the price go up or down thousands of dollars during any month. If wild fluctuations like these make you nervous, you may want to avoid Bitcoin. Otherwise, as long as you keep in mind that cryptocurrency is a smart long-term investment, these fluctuations shouldn’t be too concerning.
Another reason to reconsider investing in Bitcoin is its price. With a single share costing more than $50,000, most people can’t afford to buy whole shares of the stock. For investors who want to avoid buying partial shares, this is a negative.
Ethereum is different from Bitcoin because it isn’t only a cryptocurrency. It’s also a network that allows developers to create their own cryptocurrency utilizing the Ethereum network. While Ethereum is far behind Bitcoin in value, it’s also far ahead of the other competitors.
Even though it came out years after some other cryptocurrencies, it has far exceeded its place in the market because of its unique technology.
While Ethereum utilizesblockchaintechnology, it only has one “lane” for conducting transactions. This can lead to transactions taking longer to process when the network is overloaded.
A hack in 2016 led to more than $60 million Ether dollars lost because of a flaw in the Ethereum wallet. While the company has made strides in increasing its security, loopholes are always a risk with any cryptocurrency investment.
Binanceis one of the few cryptocurrencies to reach its peak after 2017. During that year, there was a bull market and the price of all cryptocurrencies rose on it, reaching a peak before plateauing and decreasing in value.
Unlike other cryptocurrencies, Binance Coin continued a slow but consistent trend upward after 2017. Because of its performance, Binance Coin has proven to be one of the more stable investment options, posing fewer risks.
What sets Binance Coin apart from its competitors is that it was created by a company instead of a group of tech developers. Although Binance Coin’s commitment to maintaining a strong blockchain has won over many skeptics, some investors remain leery of this cryptocurrency and its potential security issues.
Tether is the most stable of allcryptocurrenciesbecause it is tied to the U.S. dollar. For each unit ofTether, there is one dollar in the Federal Reserve Bank. This makes Tether great for investors who want to transact with their cryptocurrency .
Investors have raised questions over the actual reserve stock. There are doubts that there is truly a U.S. dollar in the reserve bank for eachTetherunit. If this were ever disproven, the value of Tether’s stock could drop quickly.
The Cardano network has a smaller footprint, which is appealing to investors for several reasons. It takes less energy to complete a transaction with Cardano than with a larger network like Bitcoin. This means transactions are faster and cheaper.
It claims to be more adaptable and more secure.Cardanoconsistently improves its development to stay ahead of hackers.
Even with a better network, Cardano may not be able to compete with larger cryptocurrencies. Fewer adopters mean fewer developers. This isn’t appealing to most investors who want to see a high adoption rate. The platform has big plans, but there are doubts about whether it can live up to that potential.
Advice
Polkadotwas created by Ethereum leaders who broke away to form their own cryptocurrency with a better network. Instead of having a single “lane” to complete transactions in, Polkadot has several.
This cryptocurrency was designed to reward genuine investors and weed out people who are just trading on the stock market to make money fast. Investors who are engaged in the company also help to make decisions on things like:
• Network fees
• Network upgrades
• Establishing or removing parachains
Polkadot’s founder, Gavin Wood, first introduced the cryptocurrency via a whitepaper in 2016. At the end of 2020, Polkadot began trading on the stock market. With such a short history, Polkadot doesn’t have a track record for comparison, making it a riskier investment for potential buyers.
Rippleis the company that unveiled the XRP token and is enticing to investors because it sets itself apart from other cryptocurrencies by offering international transactions. With a bank, international money transfers can take up to 10 business days. With Ripple, the same transactions take mere seconds.
Plus, Ripple has contracts with big banks around the world. The more contracts it has, the more accessible the Ripple cryptocurrency is to adopters.
Ripple showed promise in 2017 when its value jumped 36,000%. However, when you look at the fact that the percentage represented growing to a $2.40 stock value, it’s less impressive. As you’re researching cryptocurrencies, don’t be distracted by high percentages. Get down to the real numbers and see what the growth really means.
Originally established in 2011,Litecoinhit the market at the same time as Bitcoin. However, it didn’t take off in the same way. Litecoin boasts completing transactions four times faster than Bitcoin.
In 2017, it was the first cryptocurrency to complete a Lightning Network transaction. The transfer was completed in less than one second. If the company expands its use of Lightning Network for faster transactions, Litecoin’s value could increase dramatically.
Since Litecoin and other cryptocurrencies are tied closely to Bitcoin, their value will generally fluctuate along with Bitcoin. This means the value will go up and down just as Bitcoin does, although at a lesser rate. If you consider Bitcoin’s volatility a negative, Litecoin may not be a good choice for you.
Chainlinkis unique as a cryptocurrency because it has an appealing price. While the shares are affordable to buy, they’re also priced high enough to not be considered penny stocks. This is appealing to investors because it has proven it can increase in value, and there is still a lot of room for growth.
It’s also available for trading on Coinbase, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency apps. Being more accessible also makes Chainlink appealing to investors.
While it’s still above thousands of other cryptocurrencies, it has a lower volume and market cap than more appealing cryptocurrencies. That’s why Chainlink ranks so low on the top 10 list.
Stellar’s Lumens, also known as XLM, was established to serve a niche need within the world of cryptocurrency. It’s essentially thePayPalof cryptocurrency networks, serving as a bridge between banks and blockchain networks.
As a decentralized network, Stellar can convert any currency and trade it across channels. It makes these transactions cheaper and faster than they would be with a traditional bank.
BecauseStellar (XLM)caters to a niche market, it will likely see other companies try to compete against it. If another cryptocurrency network creates a better platform and takes traffic from Stellar, it could affect the company’s stock value.

There’s no question about it: Cryptocurrencies are here to stay. The question becomes, where is the best place to invest your money in the market?
As you decide which cryptocurrency is the best investment for you, here are some other things to keep in mind:
• The speed at which transactions are completed
• The fees associated with transacting
• The ability to use your cryptocurrency for regular purchases and bank transfers
If you’re strictly looking to invest without transacting within the network, remember that cryptocurrency isn’t a get-rich-quick scheme. Instead, you should consider it along-terminvestment.

2021-04-10 16:00:32+00:00,Coinbase IPO Set for April 14: What You Need To Know Before Investing In the Crypto Trading Platform,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coinbase-ipo-set-april-14-160032708.html,GOBankingRates,"Coinbase, one of the world’s most popularcryptocurrencytrading platforms, is soon to become open for trading to the general public. The company announced Thursday that its trading debut via a direct listing on the Nasdaq is expected to take place on April 14.
Bitcoin and Dogecoin recently experienced what Forbes called a “crypto gold rush.” Is Coinbase set to attract a gold rush of its own?
Here’s what to know about Coinbase and what its initial public offering could mean for you.
If you want to get your virtual hands on someBitcoin, you can either “mine” it yourself with expensive computing equipment and a supply of energy sufficient to operate it, or you can purchase currency that has already been extracted. Most people choose the latter, and for many, that method of choice is Coinbase.
Coinbase has been around since 2012. It envisions a future where fiat currency has been replaced by cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is the most notable example of these, but it is still only one of many.
Since then, however, people have primarilyinvested in cryptocurrencies. Rather than using them as cash, they have treated them more like stocks or precious metals than currency.
Coinbase’s role in all this is that it allows users to purchase and sell these cryptocurrencies and offers a place to keep them — adigital wallet— in the meantime.
When someone completes a transaction on Coinbase, they pay fees for the privilege of using the service. One of these is theCoinbase fee. This is either a flat rate or a variable percentage. It is based on the user’s region, product feature and payment type.
Coinbase’s other fee is the margin or spread of up to 2.00% of the transaction. This is added to the exchange rate on Coinbase Pro — the trading platform tied to Coinbase where all orders are fulfilled.
Coinbase also has a few other revenue streams that continue to grow over time:
• Coinbase Pro:A platform that enables users to trade directly on the Coinbase exchange that backs their Coinbase transactions
• Coinbase Commerce:A software-as-a-service product that provides payment processing for online merchants
• Coinbase Card:A physical Visa debit card that converts cryptocurrency to U.S. dollars, enabling users to make purchases anywhere Visa cards are accepted
• USD Coin (USDC):A cryptocurrency offered by Coinbase with a value tied directly to the U.S. dollar whereby there is always a 1-to-1 relationship between the two
Placing a dollar value on startups is tricky, but the company’s worth has skyrocketed over the last few years. Coinbase’s last formal valuation came in 2018 when it received $300 million in E-series funding and was reportedly worth $8 billion. That number has since jumped into the double digits, with Nasdaq Private Market activity in early March of 2021 indicating a value as high as $77 billion.
Keep in mind that Coinbase is well positioned as a startup to have a higher IPO than even private trades suggest. With a 2020 revenue of $1.3 billion — more than twice the $534 million figure from 2019 — Coinbase ended the year with a net income of $322.3 million.
When its profitability is combined with its massive 43-million-strong user base, it isn’t surprising that its major investors believe Coinbase’s IPO could top the $100 billion mark.
There are a few unusual elements to the Coinbase story, starting with the fact that it’s the first company of its kind to hit the stock market.
Other companies provide similar services, but Coinbase stands out because it is the entry point into crypto for people all over the world. As such, it is perfectly poised to succeed as a publicly traded company.
Further, the Coinbase IPO is not a true initial public offering, in that it is taking the less traditional route of direct listing on the Nasdaq. By doing so, it circumvents the expensive relationship with investment banks that help sell shares of a new stock during an IPO. Additionally, Coinbase stays true to its brand of decentralization by leveraging its popularity (and financial records) as a selling point.
So, should you invest in Coinbase’s IPO?
Investing in any stockcomes with an inherent risk, so you’ll have to rely on your risk tolerance, your motivation for action and your own evaluation of the company’s prospects.
That said, there are many who believe that the company’s strong financial performance in recent years combined with the growing popularity of cryptocurrency as a whole suggests that Coinbase is positioned to perform quite well as a publicly traded company. This should translate to a strong performance on the stock market.
Keep in Mind
Whatever you decide, the upcoming release of COIN on the stock market promises to be a historic and exciting event in the financial space. If you choose to invest, remember to set your budget and expectations ahead of time. Never invest more than you can afford to lose.
Coinbase has announced that its direct listing is expected to happen on April 14.
Anyone will be able to buy Coinbase shares once they become available on the public stock market.
It is uncertain what the price of COIN shares will be upon their direct listing. Sales on the Nasdaq Private Market have reached as high as $375 per share.
By April 14, Coinbase’s direct listing date, you’ll need to have selected a brokerage, set your budget, decided on the type of order you want to place (market or limit), and executed your purchase.

What Happened: Ripple saw another major win by its legal team as a federal judge exempted Ripple's executives from having to provide their personal financial records to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Ripple Labs Inc is the developer of XRP. The ruling was made by United States District Court Judge Sarah Netburn, of the Southern District of New York. In the ruling on Friday, Netburn wrote that the SEC’s requests for the records were not ""relevant or proportional to the needs of the case."" On the news, XRP price climbed by nearly 38% from $1.01 up to a high of $1.39 before correcting and settling at $1.30 as of press time. All of this price action took place within the last 24 hours. Why It Matters : The news follows this week's reports that the same judge also granted Ripple access to SEC minutes and memos “expressing the agency’s interpretation or views.” These records are said to detail why the regulator has not deemed Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) or Ether (CRYPTO: ETH) securities. Ripple — the firm which developed the XRP ledger used for interbank communication and settlements by major financial institutions worldwide — hopes that the documents will help make its case that XRP ought to be treated in the same way.

However, they’ve had little success.
An ETF is a security that tracks an asset. However, people can buy or sell it on the stock exchange like any other stock.
They can track anything. In the case of cryptocurrencies, ETFs are usually tracking a coin like bitcoin (BTC) or ethereum (ETH) or a combination of coins.
The reason ETFs are important is that they arethought to be a way mainstream investors can enterthe cryptocurrency market. ETFs hand over some responsibility of managing crypto investments to experts.
This may be more approachable to new investors who are not extremely well-versed in the world of cryptocurrencies but see their value.
Crypto ETFs are a fairly new offering.Canada became the first countryto approve one in February 2021.
The bitcoin ETF by Purpose Investments trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange. In the first week of its launch, it gained$624 million in nine days.
North America isn’t the only continent to approve crypto ETFs. Brazil was next, approvingits first ETF, the QR Capital’s bitcoin ETF. It is not listed yet but is set to go onto the Sao Paulo stock exchange in June.
The U.S. is in some ways the final frontier for ETF approval. As a long-standing global financial superpower, the decisions of the U.S. SEC are not just important for the country but also for the rest of the world.
Companies in the U.S. have been trying to get SEC approval. Currently, VanEck’s latest filing with the SECis under consideration.
The Commission acknowledged the application on March 18, which kicked off a 45-day countdown clock for a response. However, it can choose to extend the response time making the wait even longer.
This is just the latest in the string of bitcoin ETFs submitted. Alongside VanEck,Valkyrie,WisdomTree,Fidelity Investments, and Goldman Sachsalso filed applications in 2021.
However, the SEC takes time to review applications, often before swiftly rejecting them. Cameron and Tyler Winklevossapplied for a crypto ETF in 2013. It took years to be considered and was eventually rejected in 2017.
These multiple attempts have left those involved frustrated. VanEck’s Digital asset strategist Gabor Gurbacssaid in a tweet, in March:
“It’s time for U.S. regulators to step up to the plate and approve a bitcoin fund. Europeans have ETPs. Canadians have ETFs. ETFs bring many benefits to markets.”
Even Grayscale Bitcoin Trust recentlyreiterated that its interest is in converting its bitcoin trustsinto ETFs once it is approved. This would be the final stage in the life cycle of its crypto trusts.
The company initially applied for an ETF in 2016, butwithdrewbecause “the regulatory environment for digital assets had not advanced to the point where such a product could successfully be brought to market.”
The Commission has been clear on its reasons for these rejections. Many cite the lack oflocal trading volume and manipulation concerns.
For example, in the 2019 rejection of the Bitwise bitcoin ETF, the SEC leaned heavily on the fact that the filingdidn’t have enough evidencethat it could protect against fraud and market manipulation.
As its job is to protect investors from schemes that could risk them losing their money, these points all seem fair.
However, the number of rejections also speaks to the standards the SEC is requiring from those filings. In the Bitwise response, the Commission even references the Winklevoss applications and their similarities to Bitwise’s arguments.
SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce addressed thispossible issuewith the rejections in an interview with Forbes.
“I also think we’ve dug ourselves into a bit of a difficult hole by setting standards for approval that are difficult to figure out how to satisfy,” Pierce said.
Pierce often speaks out against these rejections and is the dissenting voice in the commission.
Her former boss, ex-SEC Chairman Jay Clayton, on the other hand, was in charge while the commission took on fraudulent and unregistered initial coin offerings. Many saw his stance as being thebarrier between bitcoin ETFs and approval.

Bitcoin broke back through the first major resistance level at $58,777 and the second major resistance level at $59,420 to end the day at $59,800 levels.
The near-term bullish trend remained intact supported by the latest move back through to $61,000 levels. For the bears, Bitcoin would need to slide through the 62% FIB of $26,041 to form a near-term bearish trend.
Across the rest of the majors, it was a mixed day on Saturday.
Polkadot fell by 0.88% to buck the trend on the day.
It was a bullish day for the rest of the majors, however.
Ripple’s XRPsurged by 34.82% to lead the way, withLitecoinrallying by 15.75%.
Binance Coin(+3.96%),Crypto.com Coin(+2.81%), andEthereum(+3.22%) made relatively solid gains.

Bitcoin would need to avoid a fall back through the pivot level at $59,652 to bring the first major resistance level at $61,403 into play.
Support from the broader market would be needed for Bitcoin to break out from Saturday’s high $61,243.0.
Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level and resistance at the March swing hi $61,699 would likely cap any upside.
In the event of another extended crypto rally, Bitcoin could test resistance at $65,000 before any pullback. The second major resistance level sits at $62,995.
Failure to avoid a fall back through the $59,652 pivot would bring the first major support level at $58,060 into play.
Barring another extended sell-off on the day, Bitcoin should steer well clear of the second major support level at $56,309.

Coinbase is the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States and lists about 50 cryptocurrencies for trading.
It is due to list on the Nasdaq (^IXIC) on Wednesday 14 April with a valuation that could run in excess of $90bn (£66bn).
The company will not issue any new shares in its initial public offering (IPO), instead it will sell its shares by means of a direct listing. According to itsIPO filingit is selling 114.9 million shares directly to the public.
Direct listings allow a company to forego traditional ways of relying on investment banks to set the price and also prevents early investors from profiting on opening day price pops.

Its latest results showed the company turned over $1.8bn in the first quarter of its fiscal year, this was more than it made in the whole of 2020. It expects to make between $730m to $800m in Q1. Last year, it brought in $1.3bn in revenue with a profit of $322m.

WATCH:What are the risks of investing in cryptocurrency?
Last year, a number of financial institutions and well known investors, including Paul Tudor Jones and Stanley Druckenmiller threw their weight behind cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies which sent its price skyrocketing.
This helped cryptocurrencies gain more popularity in recent months, especially Bitcoin (BTC-USD), which has more than doubled in value in the last six months.
Bitcoin has been up and down over the last few weeks,hovering back over to record highsof $60,000 (£43,768) on Saturday and Sunday, before trickling back down.
In late February, Bitcoin saw a retreat to as low as $43,000 amid uncertainty in the traditional markets over stimulus expectations and their positive effects on US bond yields.
It is currently 1.7% down on the day at $59,770.
Earlier in 2021, the market value of all bitcoin in circulation hit $1trn for the first time, according to data website CoinMarketCap. In December, it soared past Visa (V) to make it the world’s largest financial service.
But it is not the only cryptocurrency doing well. Ethereum (ETH-USD), the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world by market cap is also picking up pace, climbing to $2,190 for the first time in its history.

"" Affirm Is Still a Good Play on the Future of Shopping "" by Daren Fonda points out that newly public Affirm Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: AFRM ) is giving consumers a new way to make purchases, and no credit cards (or late fees) are required.

CEO of Real Vision TV and ex Goldman Sachs hedge fund manager Raoul Pal has spoken out about bitcoin’s volatility. With the entrepreneur calling it a feature that drives the risk-reward.
Speaking at avirtual eventthis week, Pal spoke about the price movements of the world’s biggest cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is not prone to stable movements like other assets such as gold and silver. Instead bitcoin can see moves of up to five percent per day as normal.
Pal believes investors should change their mindset and look at the volatility as a positive feature for the cryptocurrency. When speaking of the risk-reward feature, Pal stated “without that volatility, you can’t have compounded annual returns of 230%. Volatility is your friend in this occasion”.
Bitcoin has seen a rise of over 113% in 2021 alone. Making it one of the strongest gainers in the finance markets this year. The current strength of bitcoin indicates there is still more upside expected this year. Pal reiterated that while volatile, bitcoin still enjoys predominant upside even with huge swings in the market.
The current growth of bitcoin has seen financial institutions take notice of the gains that are possible in the market. Pal explains that “Everybody is getting involved, is involved, or is in the due diligence process of doing it,”.
Pal concluded by talking about bitcoin as thebest performing asset classin all recorded history. As well as being the best performing asset over any period of time he mentioned.
He concluded by talking about regulation within the cryptocurrency market. Pal believes that regulation needs to be minimal, and that it won’t hinder but rather attract more capital into the industry.
In a recent tweet, the ex hedge fund manager called the recent three month breakout “a big deal”. Pal expects that bitcoin could see another strong move to anew all-time high.",4,0.9,"The article highlights positive aspects of bitcoin's volatility and its potential for high returns, indicating a bullish sentiment.",3,0.75,"While the article highlights Bitcoin's volatility as a positive feature for high returns, such volatility also poses significant risk for investors due to potential rapid and unpredictable price swings."

The World Economic Forum sees several key industry players discuss token economics, DeFi, and digital payments, while a sports team offers salaries in bitcoin.
This week saw a volatile market that included anew all-time high for ethereum(ETH). Bitcoin (BTC) price actionfeatured massive liquidations, while Coinbasemoves forward with its public offeringin the coming days. The crypto market continues to see huge growth as it ticks over a$2 trillion market capitalization.
This week saw the World Economic Forum (WEF) hold its Global Technology Governance Summit. Several key panel membersspokeon the topic of digital payments. CEO at IDB Lab, Irene Arias spoke about the inequality of Latin Americans and their ability to access digital payments.
Arias reiterated, “We don’t want to transfer inequalities of the physical world into the digital world,” emphasizing the importance of offering digital wallets to citizens across the globe.
Similarly, Demetrios Marantis, Senior Vice-President and global head of government engagement at Visa, also commented on how governments need to focus on removing barriers to e-commerce cross border payments.
“It’s super harmful to the ability of small businesses, which are the backbone of every single nation’s national economy, to be able to start, run, grow, and thrive,” he stated.
The WEF continued itsdiscussionrelated to the crypto industry, as tokenization becomes a popular talking point. Abdulla Bin Touq Al Marri, the Minister of Economy of the United Arab Emirates, spoke about how the UAE is looking at integrating the digital economy in an effort to double the country’s GDP.
“In our digital age, tokenization compliments the information-based technology as a decentralized way of capital allocation,” Al Marri stated.
Furthermore, Al Marri also explained that the country would deploy its own digital asset to finance apost-COVID recovery. Al Marri concluded by saying that the UAE will be looking at regulating tokenization for future use. The UAE would be “putting regulation into gear to open our economy for tokenization” he said.
Sheila Warren, Head of Blockchain and Data Policy at the WEF, also spoke regarding tokenization in the economy. Warren agreed that tokens offered a wide variety of use cases in the economy. Expressing her excitement about the possibility of democratizing ownership of assets.
The blockchain specialist also touched on fractionalized ownership relating to art, as well as larger-scale assets such as real estate. Warren expressed further excitement about the potential possibilities of integrating such technology into voting rights. She commented, saying:
“All these things are going to lead to a very profound change in the ways we think about investments,” she said. ”But in particular, the ways we think of ownership.”
Plenty of discussions this week occurred at the World Economic Forum. A key topic was decentralized finance (DeFi). Speaking at the “Behind the decentralized finance hype” panel, Rune Christensen of MakerDAO brought to light thefuture of DeFiand how it is growing rapidly.
Christensen explained how DeFi can be accessed by anyone:
“It doesn’t matter if you’re a hedge fund manager on Wall Street or if you’re one of the 1.7 billion people that don’t even have a bank account. With DeFi, you have complete access.”
The CEO of MakerDAO reiterated that DeFi is still at the early phase. While the industry is looking to integrate into the real-world finance market, he expressed that DeFi is not here to dethrone the banking system:
“It’s not like trying to reinvent banks from scratch or trying to replace the financial system. […] It’s just trying to replace a specific piece of it, which is the piece that basically works the worst right now.”
Speaking at the virtual roundtable for members of the Richard Nixon Foundation, Peter Thiel of PayPalspoke outabout his concerns related to China and their bitcoin mining plans.
Thiel expressed concern bysaying, “Even though I’m a pro-crypto, pro-bitcoin maximalist person, I do wonder whether at this point bitcoin should also be thought of in part as a Chinese financial weapon against the U.S.”

2021-04-11 17:45:00+00:00,SEC’s Hester Peirce Says Cryptocurrency Market Has Matured,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sec-hester-peirce-says-cryptocurrency-174500808.html,BeInCrypto,"SEC Commissioner, Hester Peirce, said in an interview with Bitcoin.org that she believes the cryptocurrency market has matured owing to increased institutional interest.
Hester Peirce, a commissioner for the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said inan interviewthat Bitcoin, and the wider cryptocurrency market, are maturing.
Peirce attributes the trend to the increased interest in the market coming from large institutions in the mainstream financial industry. She goes on to point out that the market is also producing a number of “quasi exchange traded products”, a characteristic of a developing market.
These include investment vehicles such as Grayscale Investments’ Bitcoin and Ethereum Trusts which are extremely popular with institutional investors.
BeInCrypto previously reported that Grayscale’s Assets Under Management (AUM) for its cryptocurrency products isapproaching a record $50 billion. Its most popular investment vehicle, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), has assets valuing over $38 billion alone.
Pierce’s comments come as the SEC is considering several applications for the first cryptocurrency-backed exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US market. These include applications from renowned fund manager, VanECK, the world’s largest investment manager, Fidelity, and even Grayscale itself.
However, the SEC has rejected every Bitcoin ETF application it has seen thus far. Asked whether this could change in the near future, Pierce suggested that both the market’s maturity and interest from serious investors could alleviate some concerns the Commission might have with regards to the underlying market.
She even pointed to developments in Canada – where several ETFs have recently been approved – as an indication of what might happen in the US.
Most notably however, Pierce recognized the uniqueness of the Bitcoin market, saying it is “never going to look like an equity market for example”. She goes on to admit that trying to apply the SEC’s current framework to the cryptocurrency market when assessing the viability of a Bitcoin ETF might be “inappropriate”.
Whilst there was no confirmation as to whether the latest applications would be successful, Pierce’s remarks might indicate an SEC willing to change its relationship with cryptocurrency.
In fact, in less than two weeks, legislators in the US will confirm a new SEC Chairman, likely to be one Gary Gensler. Gensler is a self-expressed supporter of blockchain technology, calling for the Commission to support innovation in the technology in the past.
He is also known to have remarked that he thinks Bitcoin is not a security. A debate which is currently at the center of adisputebetween the regulator and Ripple Labs.
Indeed, one of the reasons Peirce presented for not being able to confirm the SEC’s stance on the latest ETF applications was that the change in leadership could also mean a change in the regulator’s approach.
If this is indeed, the cryptocurrency ETF market, which is already growing worldwide, might soon see the first US-based competitor.",4,0.85,"The article highlights positive developments and potential regulatory shifts favoring cryptocurrency, indicating a bullish sentiment.",2,0.75,"The SEC's consideration of cryptocurrency ETFs and potential leadership change suggests a cautious but evolving regulatory stance, which could introduce moderate market uncertainty."
2021-04-11 21:00:00+00:00,Crypto Long & Short: Peter Thiel Defines Bitcoin’s Accidental Role in Global Politics,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crypto-long-short-peter-thiel-210000589.html,CoinDesk,"The battle over bitcoin’s evolving role just became a piece in a complex game of political strategy. Peter Thiel’s talk earlier this week at a Richard Nixon Foundation event thrust the cryptocurrency even further out onto the geopolitical stage and highlighted two important macro narratives that investors should keep an eye on and not just for their potential impact on crypto returns. Here’s one extract from his comments: Related: Predicting the Future Is Easy, Profiting Is Hard “I do wonder whether bitcoin should be thought of as a Chinese financial weapon against the U.S. It threatens fiat money, but it especially threatens the U.S. dollar.” As with most things in life, context is key, and this statement is crying out for it. You’re reading Crypto Long & Short , a newsletter that looks closely at the forces driving cryptocurrency markets. Authored by CoinDesk’s head of research, Noelle Acheson, it goes out every Sunday and offers a recap of the week – with insights and analysis – from a professional investor’s point of view. You can subscribe here . On the surface, it seems as if he is asking U.S. regulators to prevent bitcoin from becoming more of a threat to the U.S. dollar. This is the wrong interpretation. The underlying intention is both more meaningful and more supportive of bitcoin and, ultimately, the U.S. than it may at first appear. Related: BitRiver Is Selling Tokens to Build More Bitcoin Mining Farms in Siberia Others have pointed out that Thiel is probably playing 4D chess here, and I agree with that. But I believe his underlying message is about more than bitcoin and about more than trying to get the U.S. to sit up and take notice. Bitcoin as a weapon? Before we unpack why Thiel might have said what he said, let’s look at what he might have meant. Why would bitcoin threaten the U.S. dollar? As early as 2013, Thiel was talking about bitcoin’s potential to “change the world,” and has on other occasions praised bitcoin’s reserve qualities . Story continues Thiel seems to be suggesting that bitcoin’s stable supply and worldwide reach could one day put it in a position to rival the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And his statement implies he believes China is supporting bitcoin, effectively “weaponizing it,” for this reason. Does he really believe this? He has access to several of the best minds in the crypto industry through some of the investments made by his funds , and is arguably a very smart individual himself. He has acknowledged that bitcoin is not the best payments system, and surely recognizes the dollar is a strong reserve currency precisely because it is an efficient payment method. Countries want to hold it because it is essential for global commerce. And as for China “weaponizing” bitcoin to hurt the dollar, Thiel is no doubt aware of just how long China is on the dollar. Chinese investment of U.S. Treasury bonds has been increasing since October of last year, and is now at almost $1.1 trillion. What’s more, on the current macro landscape, bitcoin is probably well below central bank policies on the list of things that could hurt the U.S. currency. And Thiel probably knows China has not exactly been “friendly” to bitcoin. On top of the years-old ban on crypto exchanges, authorities moved to shut down bitcoin miners in Inner Mongolia last month. Given the country’s constant battle with capital flight, it’s more likely it wishes bitcoin would just go away. And if it really wanted to weaken the dollar (which is debatable), it has methods within reach that would not also cause damage to the yuan. So, Thiel may have said that China was trying to bring down the U.S. dollar by “weaponizing” bitcoin, but I doubt he really believes that. So why did he say so? What is he hoping to achieve? The real issue To dive into these questions, we need even more ladlefuls of context. The theme of the seminar was technology and national security. The comment flagged above was tucked into an answer to a question about China’s digital currency plans, and a discussion flowed about the potential control that would give the state over its citizens. The conversation also touched on AI, supply chains and much more, all with a sharp tinge of concern about ideological influence. Thiel even referred to the Chinese government as “omni malevolent.” Let that sink in. Thiel’s remarks on bitcoin were most likely, as many have pointed out , an attempt to get the U.S. regulators to start taking bitcoin more seriously. But they were also about the broader threat to U.S. dominance that he sees coming from China. The first point may seem risky – many are concerned the U.S. might decide to ban bitcoin if it starts to see it as a threat. But, as I’ve written elsewhere , this is unlikely to happen as authorities have been watching the social unrest triggered by attempts to curtail cryptocurrency activity in countries such as Nigeria. Plus, a U.S. attempt to ban bitcoin would be the best advertisement that something like bitcoin is needed, and the domestic fallout could shore up China’s soft power play. It is more likely that greater attention to bitcoin regulation would support investment in crypto infrastructure, which would have extended effects throughout the industry. This includes putting institutional investors’ minds more at ease with the concept, and possibly even removing the last barriers to approval of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The arc of history Now, let’s turn to the broader context. As a declared Republican who donated generously to Donald Trump’s first presidential campaign, Thiel was closer to the last administration than this one. He, and others, are concerned the new administration will take a more relaxed stance on relations with what many see as the greatest threat to U.S. power since the Cold War: China. This almost nationalistic tone can also be heard in Kevin O’Leary’s insistence on CoinDesk TV last month that investors aren’t going to want “China coin.” What’s more, the 2021 National People’s Congress held in February ratified the next five-year plan, which focuses on, among other things, shoring up China’s position on the global stage. The previous five-year plan described how a peaceful multilateral world would benefit China. This one highlights the danger of “hegemonism,” and describes a strong economic growth based on a vibrant domestic economy that is less dependent on others. The crescendo in anti-American rhetoric and diplomatic actions point to escalating competition for not only trade but also hearts and minds on the international stage. The soft-power battle is being backed by loans and investment far beyond China’s borders in what appears to be a long game of influence. I heard an interesting metaphor the other day: The U.S. favors chess, which is about capturing the opponent’s pieces in order to kill its king. The Chinese prefer Go, which is about a slow and stealthy occupation of territory. Thiel seems to be saying the Chinese are playing Go with bitcoin as well as with blockchain, AI and other new technologies. He is effectively asking the U.S. to watch out for the territorial creep its inaction is facilitating. Thiel’s talk is likely to have repercussions, slow and subtle but real and meaningful. Hopefully, U.S. regulators will recognize the real opportunity in supporting the use of bitcoin and the development of its infrastructure. Hopefully, they will see that bitcoin is more representative of the American values of freedom and choice than many of the other new technologies making their mark on societal structures today. And hopefully they will understand that bitcoin will thrive no matter what they do, so they might as well start figuring out how to harness its innovation. For those of us who love irony, there is much to appreciate in this emerging picture. Bitcoin is being thrust into a tussle between two world powers when it was created to live outside national boundaries. It is being associated with political intent when its inbuilt ideology is supposed to flourish outside party lines. It is being used as a tool in a shift away from globalization and towards nationalism when its design is based on decentralization. Here’s the thing: Bitcoin doesn’t care. It can be what anyone wants it to be. It’s going to continue functioning the way it does, regardless of how people see it. I’m pretty sure Peter Thiel knows that, and so if he wants to use bitcoin to make larger points that he believes are necessary for prosperity and freedom, then I say we leave him to it. Coinbase Makes History Excitement is building for April 14, when crypto exchange Coinbase lists on Nasdaq under the symbol COIN. Why is this a big deal? It’s the first crypto unicorn to go public. This will bring crypto markets even more “mainstream,” as equity research teams will have to initiate Coinbase coverage and get informed about the crypto markets. Investors of all types will be able to bet on the evolution of the crypto market as a whole. Market observers will finally get a peek “under the hood” and watch up close the evolution of crypto market infrastructure. Speaking of which, earlier this week Coinbase released its estimated Q1 earnings (pending review by the accountants), which showed some impressive progress since the S1 filing. Q1 revenue of $1.8 billion vs. $1.3 billion for all of 2020 Q1 net income of $730 million vs. $322 million for all of 2020 Q1 adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 billion vs. $527 million for all of 2020 Monthly transacting users of 6.1 million vs. 2.8 million for all of 2020 Yes, these growth figures are dizzying. Will they be enough to justify the expected $100 billion valuation upon listing? Applying a typical market infrastructure multiple (using CME and Nasdaq as examples) of 35x gives a total value of $100 billion – $110 billion. However, Coinbase has higher growth potential than traditional exchanges, given the relative immaturity of the assets it trades. Could it be considered a growth stock? Let’s assume the Coinbase share price ends up being highly correlated with the bitcoin (BTC) price. As you can see from the below chart, 90-day correlations between BTC and both high-growth stocks (represented by Amazon and Tesla) and exchange stocks (represented by CME and Nasdaq) have been all over the place for the past year, implying no correlation trend. So, given that Coinbase is an exchange, and given the growth potential of the technologies and mainstream awareness of the assets it trades, let’s apply a simple average of the multiples of CME (31x) and Nasdaq (NDAQ, 24x), and growth companies represented by Tesla (TSLA, 158x) and Amazon (AMZN, 68x). This gives a Coinbase market valuation of over $200 billion, propelling it into the top 50 of global market capitalization. And with crypto assets, the number of users does not confer a linear growth outlook – it confers an exponential growth outlook as network effects kick in. So, the more than 30% increase in verified users in Q1 vs the end of the previous quarter implies a significant growth in potential value. Obviously, none of these musings are investment advice, as the initial price could be seen as too high and there could be a Deliveroo-like debacle . This is unlikely, however. The shares are coming to market via a direct listing rather than an initial public offering, so we don’t have teams of investment bankers pressured to price ambitiously – direct listing advisors usually charge a flat fee vs. the percentage-of-total-raised remuneration for IPO advisers. There are risk factors on the horizon, however, such as: Growth slows down – our latest Quarterly Review shows trading volumes tapering off in March, after the January-February surge The market turns, which will impact investor interest and the valuation of assets on the balance sheet Fees (the main source of revenue for now) compress as competition gets tougher Regulation gets more onerous, further increasing compliance costs Whatever happens to the COIN price upon listing, April 14 will be a significant day for the industry, one that will probably end up enshrined in the memes of crypto history. Chain links Bloomberg analysts have extrapolated BTC’s behavior in the 2013 and 2017 bull runs and come to the conclusion that the cryptocurrency’s price could reach $400,000 this year . TAKEAWAY: Does history repeat itself? Many technical analysts will tell you yes. I recognize that psychology plays an important role in trading decisions, but I have a conceptual difficulty in betting on chart regressions. What does make sense to me is the four-year cyclical nature of bitcoin runs, given the fundamental impact of the bitcoin reward halving every four years. That we are in a bull market, as we were four and eight years ago, feels obvious at this stage. Will it continue up into six digits? It’s certainly possible, but so many other factors are in play in crypto markets today that I am personally skeptical of simple extrapolation. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has started its review of WisdomTree’s bitcoin ETF application. TAKEAWAY: This now makes two bitcoin ETF proposals in front of the regulator. The other is VanEck’s, and a ruling on that is expected some time next month. Grayscale Investments (a subsidiary of DCG, also parent of CoinDesk) issued a statement saying that it is “100% committed” to converting its flagship Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF when that becomes possible. TAKEAWAY: Expectations that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will finally approve a bitcoin-based ETF are building, after years of SEC rejections, given 1) the improvement of crypto market infrastructure and surveillance, and 2) the pressure from the success of Canadian-listed bitcoin ETFs. This statement from Grayscale seems aimed at addressing the persistent discount to underlying value at which the trust’s shares have been trading since the beginning of March. If trust shares can be converted into an ETF with redemptions, there is an arbitrage play to be had: investors can effectively buy future ETF shares at a discount, which will disappear when redemptions become possible. The risk is in the uncertain timing. NYDIG raised $100 million in a “growth capital round” from Liberty Mutual, Starr Insurance and other unnamed property and casualty coverage firms. TAKEAWAY: Given that last month NYDIG raised $200 million from MassMutual, New York Life and others, we can reasonably expect some significant crypto-related announcements from large insurance incumbents over the next few months. Given the sheer size of the insurance industry, even if the products end up being niche, we could be looking at a sizeable new market. Online brokerage app Robinhood revealed that 9.5 million customers traded cryptocurrencies in Q1, up from 1.7 million in Q4. TAKEAWAY: Combine this with the jump in monthly transacting users that Coinbase shared in its estimated Q1 earnings release (see THE BRIEFING above) – 6.1 million, vs. 2.8 million – and you get a sense of 1) the astonishing increase in retail investor activity in Q1, and how it is starting to drive the market even more than growth in interest from institutional investors. (For more on this, see our latest Quarterly Review .) Bitcoin miners are holding on to their earned bitcoin more than they are selling them, according to a chart by Glassnode. TAKEAWAY: This is a bullish signal as: 1) it hints that miners are generally feeling optimistic about the price, and 2) it means that fewer new bitcoins are hitting the market, removing some selling pressure.

Mark Cuban, after all, is rich and famous. He owns a jet and a basketball team. He’s a reality TV star who millions tune in to watch on “Shark Tank.” If you don’t listen to a guy who created one of the world’s greatest fortunes out of nothing, who do you listen to?

It wasn’t always that way. Cuban famously lived for years on the budget of a broke college student, driving lousy cars, eating lousy food and saving, saving, saving. A serial entrepreneur, forward-thinking investor and notorious taker of calculated risks, Cuban’s seed money is now fueling startups all over the country in all kinds of industries.
The following is a selection of the finest Mark Cubanisms — from years past to just this year —that can inspire, educate and entertain investors of all levels.
Last updated: April 8, 2021
In a 2018 interview with MarketWatch, Cuban laid down some indisputable arithmetic that explains why paying off debt before you invest might just deliver the biggest returns of all.
“The best investment you can make is paying off your credit cards, paying off whatever debt you have. If you have a student loan with a 7% interest rate, if you pay off that loan, you’re making 7%, that’s your immediate return, which is a lot safer than picking a stock, or trying to pick real estate, or whatever it may be,” Cuban said.

Just like you should never gamble if you absolutely have to win, Cuban insists that the same rules apply to investing as a remedy for financial trouble.
“If you are buying because you need the price to go up and solve a financial hole you are in, that is the EXACT WRONG time to trade,” Cuban tweeted on Feb. 3. “And we all have to respect people who choose to sell because they need to. Bills don’t care what the market does [sic]. Get right and come back later.”

Cuban had some harsh words for what most investors think of as capitalism’s greatest wealth-generation machine — the stock market. In 2007, he used his blog to offer some advice to young people who aren’t sure what to do with their money.
He wrote: “Put it in the bank. The idiots that tell you to put your money in the market because eventually it will go up need to tell you that because they are trying to sell you something. The stock market is probably the worst investment vehicle out there. If you won’t put your money in the bank, NEVER put your money in something where you don’t have an information advantage. Why invest your money in something because a broker told you to? If the broker had a clue, he/she wouldn’t be a broker, they would be on a beach somewhere.”

Not everyone is going to build a successful software startup from scratch, and they don’t necessarily want to be called “idiots” for investing in the stock market. Fine, but Cuban at least wants them to avoid picking their own stocks or buying into expensive mutual funds. His advice mirrors that which fellow billionaire investor Warren Buffett has long offered, as well — buy an index fund.
In an interview with Hayman Capital Management founder Kyle Bass, Cuban said, “for those investors not too knowledgeable about markets, the best bet is a cheap S&P 500 fund,” according to MarketWatch.

Cuban told Time’s Money magazine how much he was influenced by a book called “Cashing in on the American Dream: How to Retire by the Age of 35.”
“The whole premise of the book was if you could save up to $1 million and live like a student, you could retire. But you would have to have the discipline of saving and how you spent your money once you got there. I did things like have five roommates and live off of macaroni and cheese and really was very, very frugal. I had the worst possible car.”

When the Reddit and GameStop trading frenzy went down, Cuban was able to offer some insightful advice as most of the investing world was struggling just to understand what was even going on.
On a Reddit AMA (Ask Me Anything), Cuban responded to a Redditor’s call for advice with this comparison to Bitcoin.“Many bought at the highs in 2017 and watched it fall by ⅔ or more. But they held on because they believe in the asset … When I buy a stock, I make sure I know why I[‘m] buying it. Then I HODL until … I learn that something has changed,” using text-slang acronym for “hold on for dear life.”

Without risk, there can be no reward, and the bigger the risk, the bigger the potential payout. Cuban wants investors to go for broke and swing for the fences — but only with a sliver of their investments.
“If you’re a true adventurer and you really want to throw the hail Mary, you might take 10% and put it in Bitcoin or Ethereum, but if you do that, you’ve got to pretend you’ve already lost your money. It’s like collecting art, it’s like collecting baseball cards, it’s like collecting shoes. It’s a flyer, but I’d limit it to 10%,” Cuban told Vanity Fair.

If you’re considering jumping on the cryptocurrency bandwagon, you’d be wise to place your bets on the biggest names in the game because Cuban sees way too many similarities to 1999 for comfort.
On Jan. 11, he tweeted: “Watching the cryptos trade, it’s EXACTLY like the internet stock bubble. EXACTLY. I think btc, eth, a few others will be analogous to those that were built during the dot-com era, survived the bubble bursting and thrived, like AMZN, EBay, and Priceline. Many won’t.”

Cuban has crossed philosophical paths with Warren Buffett more than once when it comes to investing fundamentals. Like Buffett, Cuban warns against investing in things you don’t understand.
In 2010, Cuban wrote on his blog, “If you don’t fully understand the risks of an investment you are contemplating, it’s okay to do nothing.” More recently, he confirmed that position by stating even more emphatically, “No. 1 rule of investing: When you don’t know what to do, do nothing.”

The best way to avoid investing in something you don’t understand is to understand whatever you’re invested in. Cuban wrote on his blog about the power of what he calls the “knowledge advantage” and what he gained from it in his early years as a budding entrepreneur.
In 2007, he wrote: “At MicroSolutions it gave me a huge advantage. A guy with little computer background could compete with far more experienced guys just because I put in the time to learn all I could. I read every book and magazine I could. Heck, three bucks for a magazine, 20 bucks for a book. One good idea that led to a customer or solution paid for itself many times over.”

The news drove up U.S. Treasury yields, which made the U.S. Dollar a more attractive investment. Kiwi traders also had mixed feelings about the strength of the economy. Earlier in the week, the Preliminary ANZ Business Confidence report came in at -8.4, worse than previously revised number at -4.1.
On Friday, theNZD/USDsettled at .7035, down 0.0026 or -0.37%.
The main trend is up according to the daily swing chart. A trade through .7070 will signal a resumption of the uptrend. The main trend changes to down on a move through .6945.
The minor range is .6943 to .7070. Its 50% level at .6995 is support.
The main range is .6589 to .7465. Traders built a support base at .6943 and .6945 inside its retracement zone at .7027 to .6934.
The short-term range is .7270 to .6943. Its retracement zone at .7107 to .7145 is potential resistance.
The direction of the NZD/USD early Monday is likely to be determined by trader reaction to .7027.
A sustained move over .7027 will indicate the presence of buyers. This could trigger a surge into .7070. Taking out this level will indicate the buying is getting stronger with .7107 to .7145 the next likely upside target area.
A sustained move under .7027 will signal the presence of sellers. The first downside target is .6995. If this level fails then look for the selling to possibly extend into the pair of bottoms at .6945 to .6943, followed by the main Fibonacci level at .6924.

According to a Sundayreport by Bloombergciting unnamed sources, officials at multiple government departments are increasing efforts to better understand possible threats posed by China’s initiative.
Officials at the U.S. Treasury, State Department, Pentagon and National Security Council are reportedly unfazed by the short-term impacts a digital yuan, or China’s digital currency electronic payment (DCEP) system, may have on the dollar.

Challenges to the U.S. global reserve currency status over the long-term, however, are a major concern. Officials have begun ramping up their efforts to understand how the digital yuan will be distributed and whether it works around trade sanctions, according to the report.
China began developing itsDCEP systemwith the involvement of the country’s largest state-owned banks as well as payments giants Tencent and Ant Financial in 2019, as CoinDeskreported at the time.
The project has since gone through multiple test runs including giftingdigital red packetsof money to citizens via a lottery that was then spent at participating stores in select cities across China.
Because of these moves, China’s central bank is positioned to be the first major central bank to issue a digital currency, giving the DCEP a headstart, an advantage that U.S. officials are starting to worry about as well, the report said.

With the ECB looking for consumer spending to support the economic recovery, we can expect some sensitivity to the numbers. Fresh lockdown measures reintroduced across a number of member states in recent weeks, however, could limit the impact of any positive numbers.

Support from the broader market would be needed for Bitcoin to break out from the March 14thswing hi $61,699.0.
Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level and resistance at $62,500 would likely cap any upside.
In the event of an extended breakout, Bitcoin could test resistance at $65,000 before any pullback. The second major resistance level sits at $64,631.
Failure to avoid a fall through the $58,943 pivot would bring the first major support level at $56,644 into play.

Its goal is to launch an automated market maker (AMM) on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC).
In an April 12announcement, Nerve Finance stated that it secured $2 million in funding from 3 Arrows Capital, CMS Holdings, and Alameda Research. Other contributors to the DeFi protocol included Immutable Capital and Primitive Ventures.
The team stated that its upcoming focus is to increase community governance surrounding the protocol. It will also be bringing in key community members to act as multi-signatories for the treasury and its smart contracts.
Nerve is an automated market maker specifically designed for trading stablecoins and pegged assets on theBinance Smart Chain. The announcement elaborated:
“The Nerve Bridge has become a mainstay of the BSC ecosystem as the largest trustless bridge for transferring funds in and out of BSC, allowing people to move millions in assets easily.”
The protocol was unveiled in late February and has since grown to a total value locked of over $600 million according to the app interface.
It started with one pool consisting of three stablecoins – BUSD, USDT, and USDC. These have now been expanded to include BTC and ETH wrapped variants. Binance itself has a token swap platform built into the exchange which also allows fast and cheap swaps using BSC.
The AMM trading fee is 0.04%, and there is no admin fee but it does charge a 0.64% deposit fee to create “sticky liquidity.” As with most DeFi platforms, it has its own governance token called NRV which was listed for trading onPancakeSwapin early March.
There were liquidity mining incentives launched on the DEX whereby 50% of all NRV minted each block went to reward initial NRV/BUSD Pancake liquidity providers, and the other 50% went to stablecoin pool LPs.
The NRV token had surged 37% over the past 24 hours to reach $5.50 according to CoinGecko. An all-time high of $5.75 was tapped during early trading on April 12.

By Tommy Wilkes
LONDON, April 12 (Reuters) - The dollar gained ground on Monday after last week's drop as traders assessed the outlook for Treasury yields, while awaiting crucial U.S. inflation and retail sales data in coming days.
Elsewhere it was a quiet start to a data-heavy week for foreign exchange markets.
The euro dipped back below $1.19 while the British pound briefly fell to a two-month low, with some analysts citing blood clot concerns around AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine, which the UK has relied heavily on for its aggressive vaccination programme.
The dollar's fortunes have been tied to the performance of Treasury yields for most of 2021, after concerns about rising inflation in the United States and a stimulus-fuelled economic rebound triggered a significant jump in yields on U.S. government bonds in February.
A fall in U.S. yields last week triggered the worst week for the dollar in 2021, but the currency found some stability on Monday.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in a U.S. media interview released on Sunday that the U.S. economy was at ""an inflection point"" and looked set for a strong rebound in the coming months, but he also warned of risks stemming from a hasty reopening.
Investors are now waiting for U.S. March inflation data due on Tuesday.
""We are set to see the first evidence of the much anticipated surge in inflation that is widely expected through the coming months as base effects from a year ago begin to take effect as the sharp declines post-COVID start to fall out of the annual calculations,"" said MUFG analysts.
They said the dollar's fortunes could well ""remain linked to 10-year yields"".
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.6462% after dropping to as low as 1.6170% last week. It had surged to a more than a one-year high of 1.7760% on March 30.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, rose 0.1% to 92.275 while the euro dropped 0.2% to $1.1875.
Bitcoin traded above $60,000, closing the gap to its record high.
Against the pound the dollar initially gained before reversing course. The British currency was last up 0.2% at $1.3734 after briefly touching a two-month low of $1.3669 .
The dollar fell 0.2% to 109.41 yen versus the Japanese currency.
""USD has some upside potential this week,"" Commonwealth Bank of Australia strategist Kimberley Mundy wrote in a report.
""Strong U.S. economic data will highlight the divergence between the U.S.’s fast economic recovery and the more stunted recoveries in other developed economies.""
The dollar can lift back toward 110 yen, while the euro has scope to retrace most of the recent gains from its almost five-month low near $1.17, she said.

2021-04-12 09:01:52+00:00,U.S dollar faces headwinds in a U.S Fed dovish stance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-dollar-faces-headwinds-u-090152166.html,FX Empire,"The greenback began the first trading session of the week on a strong footing but remained close to its yearly lows thanks to the plunging value in U.S. Treasury yields.
At the time of writing this report, the U.S Dollar Index that gauges the greenback’s strength against a basket of major currencies ticked up by 0.13% to trade at 92.278 index points at the early hours of London’s trading session.
The stronger U.S dollar has also taken the heat on commodities and certain globalstock markets, although, as ever, there were localized exceptions.
Still, dollar bulls seem to be suffering from exhaustion as anchored in today’s price action after the world’s most powerful apex bank indicated there was no cause for alarm in regards to the prevailing inflation rate seen in the U.S economy.
US Fed Chair Powell’s most recent dovish stance has also boosted global investors’ appetite for riskier assets in the broader term as he commented that they were no rush in changing the status quo.
Dollar bears in the mid-term will take the opportunity of the dark cloud cover building above the U.S dollar index (DXY) with such a dovish narrative helping tame rising U.S Treasury yields to US dollar bulls’ detriment.
However, ruling out the dollar bulls could come at a cost, with the world’s most powerful economy firing up at all cylinders, higher inflation reading possibly over a period of time could distort such assurances from the U.S Federal Reserve Bank.
Though market experts argue such change is unlikely meaning, the hurdle is high for USD bulls in breaking above 100 index points (52 weeks high) in 2021.
Withinflationremaining transitory driven, it means that the tightening of America’s monetary supply before year-end will not likely take place thereby keeping US yields consolidating between 1.6-1.8%, expect a change in the narrative comes into effect.

Mr. Nangeng Zhang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Canaan, commented, “Although the outbreak of COVID-19 caused supply chain disruptions and thus negatively impacted our revenues in the fourth quarter of 2020, our market leadership has enabled us to attain US$174 million of contracted orders with US$66 million of cash advance from customers as of December 31, 2020, thus laying a solid foundation for substantial revenue growth in 2021. During the fourth quarter, we fueled our overseas expansion, invested in our R&D capabilities, refined our supply chain management, and started mass production of our next-generation A12 series of bitcoin mining machines. All of those efforts have enabled us to begin delivering the A12 series of products at a large scale in the first quarter of 2021. In addition to fortifying our core mining machine business, we also achieved meaningful progress in our AI and Artificial IoT segments, both of which we believe have solid growth potential. After deep analysis of specific application use cases and the current market demand for computing power, we designed two new series of AI chips that will be in production in the second half of 2021.”
Mr. Tong He, Chief Financial Officer of Canaan, stated, “Due to supply chain disruptions, as the price of Bitcoin rallied in late 2020, we experienced a surge of demand for high-quality mining machines both in and outside of China. By leveraging our established market presence, we further optimized our international customer base, secured a large number of pre-orders from clients in both domestic and international markets, and streamlined our supply chain management to optimize our cash flow. Our abundant cash reserve gives us the confidence to expand our global client service coverage and develop more first-rate products going forward. Meanwhile, the rapid development of our new business initiatives should help us to launch into a new growth cycle and deliver increasing value to both our customer and shareholders over the long term.”

The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter decreases were mainly due to the decreases in total computing power sold. In the fourth quarter of 2020, although the market demand increased significantly with the rising of Bitcoin’s price, the Company did not have sufficient inventory to deliver to its customers.
Cost of revenuesin the fourth quarter of 2020 decreased to RMB29.2 million (US$4.5 million) from RMB1,136.7 million in the same period of 2019 and RMB180.0 million in the third quarter of 2020. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter decreases in cost of revenues were in line with the changes in the Company’s Thash sales volume and cost per Thash.
Gross profitin the fourth quarter of 2020 was RMB9.1 million (US$1.4 million) compared to a gross loss of RMB673.4 million in the same period of 2019 and a gross loss of RMB17.0 million in the third quarter of 2020.

The year-over-year decrease mainly reflected the changes in materials that the Company used for research and development purposes. The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily driven by the increase in salary and welfare benefits for the Company’s research and development personnel.
Selling and marketing expenses in the fourth quarter of 2020 were RMB6.1 million (US$0.9 million) compared to RMB7.7 million in the same period of 2019 and RMB3.2 million in the third quarter of 2020.

Full Year 2020 Financial Results
Total net revenuesin the full year of 2020 were RMB447.7 million (US$68.6 million) compared to RMB1,422.6 million in 2019. The decrease was mainly due to the year-over-year decline in total computing power sold and lower average selling price per Thash/s during the first three quarters of 2020. As the price of Bitcoin surged in the fourth quarter of 2020, the market demand for mining machines started to recover and the Company had received a large number of orders which were mainly scheduled for delivery in 2021.
Cost of revenuesin the full year of 2020 decreased by 78.9% to RMB409.9 million (US$62.8 million) from RMB1,938.6 million in the full year of 2019. The year-over-year decreases in cost of revenues were in line with the changes in the Company’s Thash sales volume and cost per Thash.
Gross profitin the full year of 2020 was RMB37.8 million (US$5.8 million) compared to a gross loss of RMB516.0 million in the full year of 2019.
Total operating expensesin the full year of 2020 decreased by 45.8% to RMB291.6 million (US$44.7 million) from RMB538.5 million in the full year of 2019.
Research and development expenses in the full year of 2020 decreased by 17.1% to RMB140.0 million (US$21.5 million) from RMB169.0 million in the full year of 2019, primarily due to the changes in materials that the Company used for research and development purposes.
Sales and marketing expenses in the full year of 2020 decreased by 8.8% to RMB20.0 million (US$3.1 million) from RMB21.9 million in the full year of 2019. The reduction was mainly driven by lower travel expenses.
General and administrative expenses in the full year of 2020 decreased by 62.1% to RMB131.6 million (US$20.2 million) from RMB347.6 million in the full year of 2019. This year-over-year decrease was mainly due to the higher general and administrative expenses in the second quarter of 2019, during which share-based compensation expenses under general and administrative expenses were RMB213.1 million due to the excess of appraised fair value over the transfer price of ordinary shares transferred from existing shareholders to other existing shareholders who were also employees of the Company.
Loss from operationsin the full year of 2020 narrowed to RMB253.9 million (US$38.9 million) from RMB1,054.5 million in the full year of 2019.
Net loss attributable to ordinary shareholdersin the full year of 2020 narrowed to RMB215.1 million (US$33.0 million) from RMB1,034.5 million in the full year of 2019.
Non-GAAP adjusted net lossin the full year of 2020 narrowed to RMB212.1 million (US$32.5 million) from RMB764.3 million in the full year of 2019.
Basic and diluted net loss per ADSin the full year of 2020 were both RMB1.38 (US$0.21). In comparison, basic and diluted net loss per ADS in 2019 were both RMB7.21.
Contract liabilitiesas of December 31, 2020, increased to RMB430.4 million (US$66.0 million) from RMB8.3 million as of December 31, 2019, mainly due to increased down payments for the sales orders of Bitcoin mining machines to be delivered in 2021 and beyond.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company hadcash and cash equivalentsof RMB391.3 million (US$60.0 million) compared to RMB516.6 million as of December 31, 2019. The decrease was also attributable to higher short-term investments as the Company had invested RMB62.4 million (US$9.6 million) in short-term investments as of December 31, 2020, compared with RMB11.0 million(US$1.69 million) in short-term investments as of December 31, 2019. The Company purchased short-term financial products to generate higher returns on its capital. These investments are highly liquid and can be recouped at any time.
Business OutlookAs the price of Bitcoin started to move up in the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company believes that its revenue will be substantially improved in 2021 and expects that its total net revenues in the first quarter of 2021 will be not less than RMB400.0 million. This forecast reflects the Company’s current and preliminary views on the market and operational conditions, which are subject to changes, particularly in regards to the potential fluctuations in the price of Bitcoin as well as the impact of COVID-19 on the global economy.

These forward−looking statements can be identified by terminology such as “will,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “future,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates” and similar statements. Among other things, the business outlook and quotations from management in this announcement, as well as Canaan Inc.’s strategic and operational plans, contain forward−looking statements. Canaan Inc. may also make written or oral forward−looking statements in its periodic reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on Forms 20−F and 6−K, in its annual report to shareholders, in press releases and other written materials and in oral statements made by its officers, directors or employees to third parties.

Use of Non­GAAP Financial Measures
In evaluating Canaan’s business, the Company considers and uses adjusted net income as a supplemental measure to review and assess its operating performance. The presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company defines adjusted net loss as net loss excluding share­based compensation expense.
Canaan believes that adjusted net income helps to identify underlying trends in the Company’s business that could otherwise be distorted by the effect of the expenses that the Company excludes in adjusted net income. The Company believes that adjusted net income provides useful information about our operating results, enhances the overall understanding of Canaan’s past performance and future prospects and allows for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the Company’s management in its financial and operational decision-making.
The non-GAAP financial measure “adjusted net loss” is not defined under U.S. GAAP, is not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and has limitations as an analytical tool. One of the key limitations of using adjusted net loss is that it does not reflect all of the items of income and expense that affect the Company’s operations. Share-based compensation has been and may continue to be incurred in Canaan’s business and is not reflected in the presentation of adjusted net loss. Further, the non-GAAP financial measure “adjusted net loss” may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.

Topps’ baseball NFTs are positioned to capitalize on two booming markets at once. NBA Top Shot has seen hundreds of millions of dollars in transactions in 2021 for its basketball equivalent. Meanwhile, baseball cards, an industry in which Topps is all but synonymous, haverocketed in value during the pandemicas collectors park their stimulus checks in cardboard nostalgia.
Topps’ pivot from cardboard to blockchain was a long time coming, Topps Digital Vice President Tobin Lent told CoinDesk in an interview.
“This was absolutely the plan all along,” he said. “We knew we were going to do [baseball NFTs] at some point, and we just needed to get that experience and wanted to make sure that we did it right.”
(Topps began sellinglower-profileNFTs last year in what company executives called a test run for the main event.)

The buy, sell and trade platform will give Topps an easy route to capitalize on the lucrative secondary market for NFTs. If NBA Top Shot is any indication, however, the market for blockchain-based trading cards isn’t as robust as it once was.
According to data siteEvaluate.market, the Top Shot market peaked in late February but has still clocked multiple millions in daily sales in subsequent weeks.
Topps hopes its licensed MLB play will also be able to capture collector interest.
“This is the first step with our longest-term partner into this new space, and it’s just the beginning,” Lent said.
And – should Topps’ late-April NFT launch also suffer from theoverwhelmingdemand that intermittently ground NBA Top Shot to halt in March – Lent says his team is poised to deliver.
“We try to learn from our competitors in the space like Dapper,” he said.
Unlike Dapper’s highlight-reel-esque NBA player moments, Topps’ initial offering appears to be just digitized versions of the firm’s physical baseball cards. The border designs move but the players stay put.
WAXP, the native token of the Wax blockchain, is the 165th-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, according toCoinGecko. Wax runs on a fork of EOSIO, the software behind the EOS blockchain.
Topps, which was bought for$385 millionand taken private by former Disney CEO Michael Eisner in 2007, is going public in a SPAC deal that values the company at$1.3 billion. Dapper Labs is reportedly valued at$2.6 billion.

Early estimates have suggested that Coinbase will be valued at around $130 billion when it goes live, which would add legitimacy to the industry as a whole. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong announced the companys decision to go public in late January, with Bitcoins price having rallied from $33,000 to $60,000 since the story broke. Some may argue that the listing is already priced in, although analysts are predicting that the high valuation may be the catalyst for Bitcoin to print a new all-time high. Bitcoins market cap is currently at more than $1.1 trillion, with the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem surpassing a market cap of $2 trillion last week.

However, news events like this are often perceived as a buy the rumour, sell the news type of event by traders, which could heap pressure to the downside as it did in December 2017 when Bitcoin futures was listed on CME for the first time. It is also worth considering that early investors in Coinbases direct listing may be inclined to sell at a high valuation to secure profits, which would also add more pressure to the downside.

About Dogecoin Cash
Dogecoin Cash was created as a non-inflationary complement to the original Dogecoin, utilizing several important advancements in crypto since the introduction of DOGE in 2013, including:
Proof of Content
Instead of the carbon-emitting Proof of Work mining used by coins like Bitcoin and Dogecoin, Dogecoin Cash uses the innovative new Proof of Content mechanism to distribute DOG to the community. Under the Proof of Content system, content creators can earn Dogecoin Cash by sharing links on the social platform Tipestry, where members vote to determine how much crypto each post and comment receives. Rather than encouraging energy consumption, this new system rewards people for creating and sharing content.
Proof of Work mining currently uses as much power as some entire countries including Greece and Argentina. According to a recent report published by Bank of America, ""We believe ESG-minded [environmental, social, and governance] investors have to pay attention to the enormous environmental costs of Bitcoin.""
DeFi
Designed to operate within thedecentralizedfinance ecosystem, Dogecoin Cash exists on both the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC-20 token, and on Binance Smart Chain in the BEP-20 format. It is currently tradeable on decentralized exchanges including Uniswap on Ethereum and PancakeSwap on Binance Smart Chain. Holders can also stake their Dogecoin Cash via smart contract at stake.dog, store their tokens in a wide selection of Ethereum and Biance Smart Chain wallets, and exchange them for other assets such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs).
About Kronos Advanced Technologies, Inc.
The Company was initially founded in 2002 and funded by the U.S. military to develop electrostatic air movers. Eventually, the Company moved into the consumer air purification business. It began operations as a product development company that invented and significantly changed the way air is moved, filtered, and sterilized. Historically, Kronos has focused on developing, marketing, and selling the Company's proprietary air movement and purification technology. Serving the Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) market, Kronos technology uses state-of-the-art high voltage patented processes without the use of traditional porous HEPA filters. Kronos-based products move air silently, filter, sterilize, and purify the air while dramatically reducing energy consumption to half of a 60-watt light bulb. Kronos devices can be variable in shape or size and, therefore, have the potential to be scaled-down for air purification in cars or scaled-up in size for industrial and hazardous gas destruction. The technology is currently being implemented in multiple standalone products for businesses, homes, and vehicles of all types -to move, sterilize and filter air, including removing allergens down to 14.6 nanometers, passing through our patented technology -replacing expensive outdated passive HEPA and other filtration type systems. There are broad ranges of additional markets for standalone and embedded Kronos CORE technology-based devices. Examples of immediately addressable markets include schools, universities, healthcare facilities, operating rooms, manufacturing clean rooms, and the cabins of automobiles and commercial aircraft.
Kronos is the first publicly traded company that accepts DOGE coin as a form of payment for its products, as well as other crypto currencies.
Recently, the Company filed for a provisional patent involving an innovative protective face mask with antimicrobial and anti-cellphone radiation protection features. The Company is planning to file additional patents to improve its existing technology as well as enter into new market segments but will continue to market air purifiers and other consumer products. The Company is an exclusive distributor and licensee of the latest generation of air purifiers based on the Company's CORE technologies. The Company markets its products as Airdog® and KRONOS® brands. All Kronos products come with Kronos Promise ™ -Your Satisfaction is Guaranteed!

(NASDAQ: RIOT) (""Riot”, “Riot Blockchain” or the “Company"") , one of the leading Nasdaq listed Bitcoin mining companies in the United States, announces an operations update that includes an unaudited Bitcoin (“BTC“) production and an unaudited BTC holdings update, through March 2021. Production and Operations Updates In March 2021, Riot produced 187 BTC, an increase of 80% over its pre-halving March 2020 production of 104 BTC. In Q1 2021, the Company produced 491 BTC, an increase of 75% over its pre-halving Q1 2020 production of 281 BTC. As of March 31, 2021, Riot holds over 1,565 BTC on its balance sheet, all of which was produced by its mining operations. On April 6, 2021, the Company bolstered its management team, appointing Megan Brooks as Chief Operating Officer and welcoming Phil McPherson as Vice President, Capital Markets and Ryan Werner as Vice President, Finance. On April 8, 2021, Riot announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire Whinstone US, Inc. (“Whinstone”), creating a US-based industry leader in Bitcoin mining. The Company plans to continue to provide monthly operational updates and unaudited production results through the end of 2021. These updates are intended to keep shareholders informed of Riot’s substantial growth as it continues to deploy its expanding mining fleet. New Miner Acquisitions On April 7, 2021, Riot announced a large-scale contract for the purchase of 42,000 S19j Antminers for $138.5 million from Bitmain Technologies Limited (“Bitmain”). This purchase represents a significant step forward in Riot’s strategic initiative to increase its Bitcoin mining hash rate, which is now estimated to reach approximately 5 exahash per second (EH/s) by the end of 2021, and 7.7 EH/s once fully deployed by the end of 2022. This level of growth represents a 93% increase over the Company’s previously estimated committed hash rate capacity of 4.0 EH/s by October 2021. Recent Miner Deliveries In connection with previously announced purchase orders with Bitmain in August 2020, 2,400 S19 Pro Antminers were shipped in late March and early April 2021, and are in the process of being received at Coinmint, LLC’s (“Coinmint”) facility in Massena, NY. Installation of these 2,400 miners is expected to be completed by late April, and upon deployment, Riot will have a total of 16,146 Antminers in operation utilizing approximately 51 megawatts (“MW”) of energy, with an estimated hash rate capacity of 1.6 EH/s. Story continues Hash Rate Growth By Q4 2022, Riot expects a total hash rate capacity of 7.7 EH/s with a fleet of approximately 81,146 Antminers, 95% of which will be the latest generation S19 series model. When fully deployed, the Company’s total fleet is expected to consume approximately 257.6 MW of energy with an overall hash rate efficiency of 33 joules per terahash (J/TH). As a market leader, this continues to demonstrate Riot’s commitment to building one of the most efficient Bitcoin mining fleets in the industry. Acquisition Announcement On April 8, 2021, Riot announced the signing of a definitive agreement pursuant to which Riot will acquire Whinstone, including all of its assets and operations, for consideration of $80 million cash plus a fixed 11.8 million shares of Riot common stock, equal to an implied total transaction value of approximately $651 million based on Riot’s closing share price of $48.37 on April 7, 2021. Whinstone is the owner and operator of North America’s largest Bitcoin hosting facility, with 300 MW in developed capacity and an attractive long-term power purchase agreement. Whinstone’s facility is based in Rockdale, Texas and is located on a 100-acre site with a total power capacity of 750 MW. Whinstone’s team is comprised of approximately 100 employees who have built Whinstone’s Texas operations from greenfield to commercialization in less than twelve months. The acquisition of Whinstone is a transformative event for Riot and its shareholders. Riot views Whinstone as a foundational element in its strategy to become an industry-leading Bitcoin mining platform, on a global scale. Upon the closing of this acquisition, Riot is expected to be the largest publicly traded Bitcoin mining and hosting company in North America, as measured by total developed capacity. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2021, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory clearances. Financial Update The Company announces it will be filing its 2020 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q on May 17, 2021. About Riot Blockchain, Inc. Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ: RIOT) focuses on cryptocurrency mining of Bitcoin.

2021-04-12 13:05:34+00:00,Five Biggest Altcoin Gainers – April 5 – 12,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/five-biggest-altcoin-gainers-april-130534501.html,BeInCrypto,"BeInCrypto breaks down some of the biggest altcoin movers and shakers from the previous week. Will their momentum continue?
During the week of April 5 – 12, the biggest altcoin gainers were:
• Kucoin Token (KCS) – 170%
• Bitcoin Gold (BTG) – 166%
• XRP (XRP) – 97.5%
• Binance Coin (BNB) – 68%
• PancakeSwap (CAKE) – 65%
KCS has been increasing parabolically since the beginning of the month. So far, it has done so by 270%.
So far, it has managed to reach a high of $20. This is only slightly below the all-time high of $21.30 reached in Jan. 2018.
There is some weakness developing, visible in the form of bearish divergence in both the RSI & Stochastic oscillator.
Therefore, some rejection could occur once HOT reaches the ATH area. This would also make sense since the upward movement has not retraced since $4.
Therefore, a breakout above the ATH area on the first try would be unusual.
BTG was subject to a very rapid increase last week, reaching a high of $121.35.
The upward move took it to the long-term resistance area of $110, where it was rejected.
Technical indicators in the weekly time frame are bullish, suggesting that the long-term trend is also bullish.
However, until BTG manages to break out above this area or gets rejected, the short-term trend direction cannot be determined.
If BTG gets rejected, the closest support levels are found at $77.8 and $61.
On the other hand, the next resistance is found at $275.
Similar to BTG, XRP has reached the 0.382 Fib retracement level of the previous downward movement.
The long-term trend is clearly bullish, with the RSI just moving above 70 and theStochastic oscillatormaking a bullish cross. The next resistance area is found at $2.25.
However, some short-term retracement could occur before the continuation of the upward movement.
BNB has been moving upwards since breaking out from asymmetrical triangleon March 30.
Since then, it has increased by 112%.
Technical indicators are bullish, but BNB has reached the $208 resistance area. The 2.61 external Fib retracement creates this. Besides, the rally is completely parabolic.
The next resistance area is found at $770.
CAKE has been moving upwards since breakout out from the $18 resistance area on April 18.
It is currently approaching the next resistance area, which is found at $30. This acted as the all-time high on March 18.
CAKE is expected to reach it.

The company, which has become the most popular regulated cryptocurrency exchanges and depositories on the web, is anticipated to enjoy a blockbuster debut on the Nasdaq on Wednesday.
It was most recently valued at $91.5bn – higher than BP’s current market capitalisation of $84bn. However, that price tag is predicted to inch closer toward $100bn on Wednesday, possibly even beating that of Facebook which was valued at $104bn when it went public in 2012.
In the first three months of the year Coinbase made $730m in profit on revenues of $1.8bn, bolstered by Bitcoin’s rise. The exchange lured 13m new users in the first three months of 2021. Brian Armstrong, Coinbase’s chief executive, says that the company has been profitable since 2017.
Some investors remain sceptical as to whether Coinbase, and the nascent cryptocurrency industry, signifies a new world order or whether the company’s success is a blip fuelled by a frothy market, US government underwriting and the younger generation who has had more time on their hands to invest their Covid-19 stimulus money in novel ways.
As almost all of Coinbase’s revenue is generated from transactions, Wall Street analysts are waiting to see whether the volatility of cryptocurrency means the company is in for a bumpy ride.
In the company’s Initial Public Offering prospectus, Mr Armstrong slammed the banking system's “high fees, delays, unequal access, and barriers to innovation”.
He said: “If the world economy ran on a common set of standards that could not be manipulated by any company or country, the world would be a more fair and free place and humans would accelerate... the crypto economy offers a more global, free, and fair alternative to traditional economies that is native to the internet.”
Despite this, Mr Armstrong is keen to move away from simply taking a cut on customers’ trades and wallets toward becoming something of a bank on its own. It already offers a debit card in the UK that allows customers to spend their crypto at retailers which take Visa.
Despite its healthy balance sheet, this desire to replicate a financial system has led critics to accuse Coinbase of becoming a contradiction in terms, one which could ultimately cause its downfall. For many, the attraction to Bitcoin or other digital coins is their fragmented nature, separate from the central banking system and “decentralised”.",4,0.85,"The article highlights Coinbase's significant valuation and profitability, indicating strong positive sentiment, despite some skepticism about the cryptocurrency industry's sustainability.",3,0.75,The high valuation of Coinbase amidst skepticism and its reliance on transaction-based revenue introduces market volatility and regulatory scrutiny risks.

The world’s largest crypto exchange also said that they will price and settle stock tokens in Binance USD (BUSD). BUSD is the exchange’s stablecoin which is pegged to the U.S. dollar.
According to the announcement, Binance launched stock tokens to provide exposure for its users to more traditional markets. By utilizing stock tokens, Binance users will also be able to benefit from several unique advantages the exchange provides.
One benefit is thelarge amount of liquiditythat comes with the trading volumes on the world’s largest crypto exchange. The ability to trade fractional units of publicly traded equities also lowers the barrier of entry for entry-level traders. Stock token holders will also receive capital returns on the underlying stock, such as dividends and stock splits.
“Stock tokens demonstrate how we can democratize value transfer more seamlessly, reduce friction and costs to accessibility, without compromising on compliance or security,” said Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance.

LONDON, April 12 (Reuters) - HSBC has banned customers of its online share-trading platform from buying or moving into their accounts MicroStrategy Inc stock, a message seen by Reuters showed, calling it a ""virtual currency product"".
The bank will not facilitate the buying or exchange of products related to or referencing the performance of virtual currencies, the message to an HSBC InvestDirect client said. Bitcoin is the largest and best-known virtual currency.
MicroStrategy did not respond to an email and phone message requesting comment. The U.S. business software firm is led by bitcoin proponent Michael Saylor and owns bitcoin worth billions of dollars.
While HSBC will allow the holding, sale and outgoing transfer of MicroStrategy shares, it will forbid new purchases or incoming transfers, said the message dated March 29.
""HSBC has no appetite for direct exposure to virtual currencies and limited appetite to facilitate products or securities that derive their value from VCs (virtual currencies),"" HSBC said in a statement.
HSBC InvestDirect is available to customers in countries including Canada and Britain.
The bank said its policy towards cryptocurrencies had been in place since 2018 and is kept under review. It could not immediately say which countries the ban applied to.
The move comes amid a growing embrace of cryptocurrencies by large financial firms, companies and investors seeking yield in a world of ultra-low interest rates.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc said last month it would offer investments in bitcoin and other digital assets to its wealth management clients. Morgan Stanley has also started offering clients investments to the emerging asset class.
MicroStrategy has along with Tesla Inc and payments firm Square Inc become one of several publicly listed U.S. companies to buy large amounts of bitcoin for its treasury.
MicroStrategy said last week it owns around 91,579 bitcoins.

2021-04-12 16:17:29+00:00,Square-Led COPA Sues Craig Wright Over Bitcoin White Paper Copyright Claims,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/square-led-copa-sues-craig-161729323.html,CoinDesk,"If you send out enough cease-and-desist orders, its likely youll get a lawsuit in return. That appears to be the case with nChain Chief Scientist Craig Wright and his legal crusade to block people within and without the cryptocurrency community from hosting the Bitcoin white paper. The Cryptocurrency Open Patent Alliance (COPA) is filing a lawsuit against Wright in the U.K. over his copyright claims to the Bitcoin white paper. The Alliance was formed in September 2020 and founded by Square to pool patents and preserve the industrys open-source spirit. Wrights representatives sent Square a cease-and-desist notice dated Jan. 21, 2021, demanding that Square stop hosting the white paper on its site. At the time, COPA sent back a legal response on behalf of Square, which boiled down to this: Prove youre Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of the white paper first. Related: Europe's Investment Bank Plans to Settle Bonds in Euros Using Blockchain: Report It does not appear Wright responded with the requested proof by the Feb. 19 deadline COPA set. COPA is about truly empowering the crypto community with innovation and removing blockers to innovation, said a spokesperson on behalf of the COPA board. This is not the last thing were going to take up on behalf of the community. The complaint asks the court to resolve the question as to whether Craig Wright has copyright ownership rights over the Bitcoin white paper. Pursuing a legal case on behalf of the cryptocurrency community is the first instance of COPA throwing its money and weight behind a cause that has plagued the space for years, and it could have widespread ramifications. If a court rules that Wright does not have ownership rights over the Bitcoin white paper, it would be a serious blow to his legal argument that he is Satoshi Nakamoto. Wrights long legal trail Related: Thorchain Is Ready to Grease the Wheels of Crypto-to-Crypto Trading Story continues Wright, notorious for having an itchy legal finger, had sent his latest round of cease-and-desist orders to Bitcoin core developers, causing the Bitcoin white paper to be taken down from Bitcoincore.org, a canonical repository for the Bitcoin software and educational resources like Satoshis 10-page thesis, CoinDesk wrote at the time. Regardless of whether theyre accurate or not, legal claims take time, energy and, importantly, finances to contest. COPA is stepping in on behalf of the community to protect those small parties, particularly Bitcoin developers, who are essential to the community but dont have a ton of resources, according to a spokesperson for the COPA board familiar with the matter. Beyond that, in late February Wright also filed a lawsuit demanding Bitcoin developers give him access to stolen Mt. Gox funds. As CoinDesk reported at the time even though Bitcoin Core contributors have no control over the networks wallets, Wright wants Bitcoins developers to hand him the keys. Following Wrights initial filings against Bitcoin core developers, but prior to the paper being removed, a number of companies, including Square Crypto, crypto venture fund Paradigm , policy think-tank Coin Center and Facebook stablecoin subsidiary Novi , among others, decided to host it themselves. The action was meant to be a sign of solidarity. The letter accompanying COPAs response laid out a number of simple questions for Wrights representatives to answer regarding his claims. These included the general basis of the claim, where he was when he wrote the white paper, what dates he wrote it and what copyright laws apply, among a number of others. Wright has a long legal paper trail of using the law to try and silence his critics and even filed a copyright claim in May 2019 with the U.S. Copyright Office over the original Bitcoin code and the Satoshi white paper. None of his legal attempts to assert he is Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto have been successful. The new COPA board The board of COPA, which helps determine the organizations actions and will guide the course of the lawsuit, is also being updated. Ultimately, COPA will have a nine-person board representative of the entire community, with three spots reserved for independent members. Thus far, two board members represent member organizations: Brittany Cuthbert, senior counsel at Coinbase, and most recently Kirupa Pushparaj, deputy general counsel at Square. Four more board members from COPA organizations will be added in the future. Three additional independent members will round out the COPA board. These included Steve Lee, Square Crypto lead; Dan Robinson, research partner at Paradigm; and Jerry Brito, executive director of Coin Center. CoinDesk can also report Pushparaj will also be appointed the board chairman.

The company, which operates several mining farms in Siberia for 150 megawatts in total, would use the proceeds from the sale to open more such facilities. The token runs on the Ethereum blockchain, the main launchpad for fundraising tokens since the heady days of the 2017 initial coin offering (ICO) boom.
While ICOs have largely faded, BitRiver’s token offering, announced Monday, is one of several to hit the market this year tied to the mining sector.
Related:Bitcoin Hits New All-Time High Above 62.7K
In late March,Blockstreamlaunched a token representing the value of hash power at Blockstream’s mining facility and offered buyers an indirect exposure tobitcoin. Tau Protocol recently launched a tokenpegged to bitcoin hashrateand backed by Genesis Mining, Binance Pool, Atlas Mining and others.
BitRiver, however, takes a different approach. Instead of indirect exposure to bitcoin, it offers clients a form of tokenized contracts for mining services, with a bonus income in tokens.
“It’s a utility token and it ideally fits our goal: to raise funds from people who will be using our future infrastructure,” BitRiver CEO Igor Runets told CoinDesk.
BitRiver, registered in Gibraltar but with a home base in Siberia, operates so-called mining hotels, or data centers for miners who place their ASICs there. Clients pay for the units of power their equipment uses to mine crypto, with the price including other expenses like machine maintenance.
Related:Europe's Investment Bank Plans to Settle Bonds in Euros Using Blockchain: Report
The demand for BitRiver’s services has been significantly exceeding the company’s capacity, Runets said. In addition to the main data center in Bratsk, the company has several smaller venues that together comprise 50 more megawatts, but that’s still much less than prospective clients want, Runets said.
“We now see demand for 400 megawatts of power,” he said. “It’s a huge amount of construction work. We’re now looking to buy more land, buildings [and] start to build more data centers.”
Investments for that, as Runets expects, will come from the token sale. BitRiver is aiming to sell 100 million tokens for more than $35 million.
The demand for BitRiver’s services comes mostly from Asia, Runets said, especially from China, South Korea and Japan. BitRiver evenopened an office in Seoulearlier in April to cater to that region, and the token sale will be on the Korean exchange Bithumb.
Growing demand has been also coming from Persian Gulf countries, namely Qatar, Saudi Arabia and UAE, Runets said: “Over the recent months, the market there has been growing, people have a lot of money to invest, and the surging price of bitcoin drew attention [to mining].”
Some of the expansion has been ongoing. BitRiver recently founded ajoint venturewith a Russian hydropower giant En+ to build a new mining venue of 10 megawatts. According to Runets, that farm is now operational.
Another venue, of 100 more megawatts, is currently under construction in the special economic zone of Buryatia, Russia’s East Siberian region on the border with Mongolia. In the neighboring Krasnoyarsk region, BitRiver will arrange another venue using the building of an electric boiler now rarely in use, with a ready-to-use capacity of about 82 megawatt, the token sale white paper said (read the white paper at the bottom of this story).

The BTR token sale is set to go live on April 19 on Bithumb. BitRiver is planning to sell 100 million tokens with a price starting at 35 cents. Each token would provide a buyer with an allocation of 1 watt of power for a full year. Given that there is on average 720 hours in a month and 8,640 hours in a year, one kilowatt-hour would cost 4 cents to a token holder.
Token holders will be able to get their ASICs installed and serviced in BitRiver’s warehouse in three months upon purchase. Users will also be able to pay up to 10% of their bills to BitRiver in tokens, and have their ASICs repaired for free in that case.
The company will also pay bonus tokens to the token holders, at a rate of 10% per year, using its own stash of 65 million tokens that won’t go into public circulation. In another step to make BTR attractive, BitRiver promises to buy back all the tokens by April 12, 2026, at the nominal value of 0.3504 USD per token.
BitRiver is not limiting the offer geographically, unlike many token issuers that would wall off American users to avoid running afoul of the U.S. regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Blockstream, for example,restrictedits token sale to non-U.S. qualified investors.
Runets explained that, as BitRiver isn’t selling the tokens directly, it’s up to Bithumb to run due-diligence on potential buyers.
Crypto regulations in Russia have been in flux recently, with acrypto taxation billcurrently awaiting passage in the national parliament. The uncertainty led many of BitRiver’s clients in Russia to establish foreign legal entities and operate through them, Runets said.
However, when asked about potential regulatory risks for a large-scale mining farm construction, he sounded moderately optimistic: “We don’t see any prerequisites for an all-out ban,” he said.

In addition, the World Economic Forum (WEF) has hadnumerous discussionsabout the DeFi sector. Finally,HBTClaunchedsix newETFs, with Kava.io (KAVA) being one of them.
Compound (COMP) has broken out from a descending resistance line, but was rejected by a horizontal resistance area. Aave (AAVE) is trading inside a symmetrical triangle, from which a breakout is likely.
COMP has been decreasing alongside a descending resistance line. It has been doing so since reaching an all-time high price of $573 on Feb. 12.
On April 1, it managed to break out above this line, and proceeded to reach a high of $562 three days later. Despite this, COMP was rejected by the $550 resistance area. It is currently trading close to the descending resistance line from which it previously broke out. The closest horizontal support level is found at $340.
Technical indicators are neutral, leaning on bearish. While the Stochastic oscillator has made a bullish cross, both theMACD&RSIare moving downwards.
Therefore, it is not yet clear if COMP will bounce at the line which previously acted as resistance or if it will fall to the $340 area instead.
A closer look at the increase since Feb. 23 suggests that themove is corrective. Therefore, it is more likely that COMP is in an A-B-Cflat corrective structureand will decrease towards the $340 support area once more.
• COMP has broken out from a descending resistance line.
• It is facing resistance at $540.
KAVA has been moving downwards since reaching an all-time high price of $8.13 on April 6.
Currently, it is in the process of re-testing the $6.35 area. The area previously acted as resistance, and it is likely that it will act as support during this decrease.
While technical indicators are still bullish, they are showing a lack of strength.
The MACD has generated bearish divergence. The RSI is decreasing, but is still above 50. Similarly, the Stochastic oscillator has lost strength, though it has yet to make a bearish cross.
Nevertheless, as long as KAVA is trading above the $6.35 area, this can still be considered a bullish re-test.
The shorter-term six-hour chart shows a breakout from a descending resistance line. In addition, the ensuing decrease looks like anA-B-C corrective structure.
If waves A:C have a 1:1 ratio, it would take KAVA down to $5.90, close to the 0.618 Fib retracement support level.
Afterwards, an upward movement that takes KAVA towards anew all-time highnear $12 is expected.
• KAVA has broken out from a descending resistance line
• There is support at $6.35 and $5.75

AAVE has been decreasing since Feb. 10, when it reached an all-time high price of $581.667. Since Feb. 18, it has been trading inside asymmetrical triangle.
Currently, it is approaching the point of convergence between resistance and support, at which point a decisive move is expected.
Technical indicators are bullish. Both the MACD & RSI are increasing, and the former is very close to crossing into positive territory.
Therefore, a breakout from this pattern is expected. If so, the next resistance levels would be found at $468 and $583, respectively.

The truth is, I’m not completely sure I know. However, as always, I like looking at analogies from other industries and times to see if I can glean some insights. This isn’t investment advice and my aim here isn’t really to provide investment advice. This is an opportunity to step back and think about which companies and strategies might be winners if we can generalize some good lessons from the past.
The most obvious approach to investing in the future of blockchain technology is to buy into the blockchains you believe will be successful, such as Ethereum and Bitcoin. On the surface, that may seem like a direct and simple plan but it may not be that easy. In thinking about this topic, I’ve come up with two key analogies from history and, unfortunately, they both suggest there’s no easy answer.
Paul Brody is EY’s Global Blockchain leader.
Related:Linux Foundation, Insurance Group Roll Out Platform to Cut Costs Using DLT
In the case of Ethereum, this blockchain is increasingly becoming an ecosystem of complex business networks. The network effects that drive growth and innovation are clearly visible in the way the decentralized finance ecosystem has exploded and the degree to which DeFi services interoperate with each other. Growing demand for transactions within the Ethereum ecosystem has, in turn, led to soaring transaction costs and a rising value forether, which is needed to fund transactions on Ethereum, as people compete for a limited transaction capacity.
Superficially, it’s easy to predict the value of ether will soar as demand for transactions rises. In fact, there is no guarantee that will happen. In Ethereum, the fees that are required to process transactions are called gas, and the analogy with gas prices in the real world is a very good one: As gas prices go up, people quickly turn to engineering more efficient engines. The same is happening in Ethereum. We see multiple paths with different technologies that will likely raise the network capacity by a factor of over 1,000. That’s a lot of extra capacity.
If Ethereum does become the foundation of a new digital global economy, the value of ether will certainly appreciate relative to other currencies, but perhaps not enough to satisfy a typical investor who is used to thinking about the 7%-10% annual returns you get in the stock market. The U.S. economy surpassed Britain’s in 1916. At that time, you needed nearly five U.S. dollars to buy one British pound. Today you need fewer than two dollars. That’s appreciation, yes, but not much over the course of a century. In that context, buying U.S. dollars as an investment in the U.S. economy would not have turned out very well.
Superficially, it’s easy to predict that the value of Ether will soar as demand for transactions rises.
Related:Bitcoin Hits New All-Time High Above 62.7K
A better analogy might be to think of Ethereum as a digital version of the global economy or the internet and ether as the foundation currency. And again, that doesn’t give us a good easy answer. The U.S. economy, the world’s largest, has been growing around 2%-3% annually for decades. And while the U.S. dollar’s purchasing power has declined an average of 2.2% a year due to inflation, the U.S. stock market has risen by around 7%-9% a year (after inflation) during the same time period.
The lesson here: A stable medium of exchange (the dollar, on in this case, ether) is a necessary condition for growth and value to be created, but if you want to participate in that growth, you will need to buy into the companies that create it.
The internet gives us another take on this. In the go-go days of the late-1990s, internet startups raised money nearly as fast as blockchain startups do today. Enormous amounts of money flowed into high-risk ventures. Often these startups had great ideas about how the internet would transform our daily lives – and they were often right.
Same-day delivery of essentials? Kosmo.com. Home grocery delivery? Webvan. Social networks and streaming music: Myspace. Every single one of them was right about the future, and it didn’t save them from failure. There’s a good chance that many of the brilliant blockchain startups we see today will see the same end: being completely right about the future and frustratingly unable to cash in.
See also: Paul Brody –This Isn’t the Revolution I Signed Up For
One theme cited frequently in Silicon Valley in the 1990s was that of Levi Strauss, a local San Francisco company still in business. The original Levi Strauss set up shop selling jeans and clothing to local miners lured to California by the gold boom. Most of those gold mines went broke and nearly all the miners did, too. But those selling clothing and equipment did just fine. Applied to the internet of the 1990s, that meant investing in networking companies and servers, a bet that seemed a good one.
You can apply the same logic today to those companies looking to scale up Bitcoin and Ethereum. We don’t know how these layer 2 applications will finally be used, but we know there will be enormous demand for them. However, a quick survey of the layer 2 business suggests it’s every bit as crowded as every other segment in this space, which makes picking winners very difficult. Indeed, our view that selling jeans and tools to miners may be informed by survivor bias – we only know about the companies that survived the end of the mining boom, not all the outfitters that perished along the way.
There is one investing strategy that has stood the test of time: passive index investments. Picking winners is hard, even when you are right about what the future may look like. What you can do is pick the broad category for your investments. Decades of research has shown that it’s nearly impossible to beat the market as whole. All of that research was done on the stock market, but there’s no reason to think that blockchains as the next big digital engine of growth and innovation will be any different. As philosopher Georges Santayana said, “Those who don’t learn history are condemned to repeat it.”

The euphoria over thefirst major cryptocurrency player to go publicis of a piece with the damn-the-fundamentals craze that's spawned the [hotlink]Tesla[/hotlink] phenomenon and pushed U.S. equities to near-bubble territory. Wall Street analysts and Bitcoin-loving investors are forecasting that Coinbase could debut at a $100 billion valuation.
To justify that number, the math shows, Coinbase would need to mushroom into the biggest financial exchange in the world. ""It's part of the overall frenzy creating bubbles everywhere,"" says David Trainer, an analyst at research firm New Constructs. ""When you do the numbers, there's no way to make an argument for owning this stock with a straight face.""
Trainer just released anexcellent analysis of Coinbase's prospects. It shows how new competition will hammer today's fat margins and argues that the crypto market won't be nearly as gigantic as Coinbase anticipates—all told making for a franchise worth a fraction of what its fans will be paying on opening day.
Coinbase turned strongly profitable last year, more than doubling revenues from $483 million to $1.14 billion and lifting operating profits from a $45 million deficit to $409 million. Its registration statement discloses that Coinbase generated 87% of those revenues from trading and selling Bitcoin, Ethereum, and almost 50 other coins for both retail and institutional customers. Surprisingly, money managers and corporations now account for over half of its trades, bolstering its pitch that crypto is going mainstream in a big way. Its 35% operating return on sales equaled the 2020 margin posted by Goldman Sachs’s Global Markets franchise in one of its best years ever.
But what's really ignited Coinbase fever is the astounding results for its March quarter, released on April 6. Its Q1 revenues soared 11-fold to $1.8 billion, 58% more than it collected inall of2020, and operating income rose to over $1 billion, doubling the figure for last year. Its operating margin of around 55% far exceeds what the trading arms of the Wall Street banks pocketed in a banner 2020.
Read:Coinbase is going public without an IPO. Here’s how its direct listing will work
But here's the real head-spinner: Coinbase generated 0.46% on each dollar it traded in cryptocurrencies, or almost $300 for every Bitcoin it bought and sold for customers. It's the impossibility of maintaining anything like those superrich, virtually never-before-seen trading margins that underscores how Coinbase's likely valuation will be wildly out of whack with its actual prospects.
In its S-1, Coinbase details that it charges customers a flat fee, reportedly around 0.5% on the dollar value of a Bitcoin or Ethereum trade. That charge can be lower or higher depending on the volumes—the more business a customer trades, the lower the percentage—or the regions where the client operates. It also collects much smaller amounts from the spread between the ""ask"" at which it buys for customers, and the ""bid"" at which it sells. How does the Q1 average fee of 0.46% compare with the figures for the two largest owners of securities exchanges in America, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), and [hotlink]Nasdaq[/hotlink] Inc.?
In 2020, ICE and Nasdaq each made an average of 0.01% on each dollar of securities' trades. Hence, Coinbase reaped about 50 times the margins of those longstanding, gargantuan marketplaces. It generated the equivalent of three-quarters of Nasdaq's trading revenues—$1.5 billion versus $2.0 billion—on 2% of the volumes.
It can't last, says Trainer. He predicts that fees for trading cryptocurrencies will follow a similar downward trajectory as those in stocks, possibly all the way to zero. Coinbase's slice of each transaction is so big, and its profits so gigantic, that rivals can slash what they're charging and still mint huge profits. ""Competitors such as Gemini, Bitstamp, Kraken, Binance, and others will likely lower or zero trading fees to take market share,"" he says. ""If margins are that good, you invite competition."" That will start a ""race to the bottom"" similar to the contest for market share that triggered the collapse, then virtual elimination, of stock commissions in 2019. Trainer also expects traditional brokerages to soon offer trading in cryptocurrencies, further pressuring Coinbase's rich fees.
Trainer ran the numbers. For Coinbase to reach $100 billion market cap by 2027, its revenues would need to jump 50% a year to $21.3 billion, while free cash flow keeps pace, waxing to $3.2 billion, more than 10 times the figure for last year. It would still be selling at a rich multiple of 30 times cash flow. At $20-billion-plus, Coinbase would exceed the combined 2020 revenues of ICE and Nasdaq by 50%.
Put simply, to reach the size worthy of a $100 billion market cap—and that's starting today—Coinbase would probably need to become the biggest exchange in the world. That's the bet investors are making if they buy its shares at the April 14 offering and beyond.
For Trainer, grabbing the trophy looks like a mathematical impossibility. If Coinbase's operating margins decline to the average level of 23% for the 18 largest investment banks—still a big number—and its revenues grow at a strong 21%, the rate that Nasdaq achieved in its rapid growth phase, it will be worth $18.9 billion, or over 80% less than the $100 billion it could command next week.
Another distressing metric: Say Bitcoin's trading margin declines from 0.46% to 0.10%. That's still 10 times what ICE and Nasdaq are generating. To reach the $21.3 billion in revenue that rings the bell, byFortune’s estimates, Coinbase would need to trade $17 trillion a year in Bitcoin and other tokens. That'sfour timesthe total volumes for all cryptocurrencies, on every exchange, for 2020.
For Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, a future in which such epic numbers are achieved looks anything but impossible. The S-1 states that ""crypto has the potential to be as revolutionary and widely adopted as the Internet."" He's selling a growth story for an investment that's still far from mainstream. For Trainer, Coinbase is the epitome of a ""meme stock that's traded without regard for the fundamentals."" The vision is compelling as long as it remains lofty and doesn't get too specific about the heroics needed to be worth $100 billion. Investors should keep in mind that they'll be paying a stratospheric price for backing a daring expedition that's unlikely to reach the mountaintop.

Jones’ investment firm, QueensBridge Venture Partners, got into Coinbase’sSeries B roundback in 2013 when it raised $25 million. Around that time Coinbase was valued at about $143 million, according toPitchBook.
The Nas news shows just how far Coinbase’s public listing will ripple across the world of venture capital, with everyone fromWall Street veteransto A-list celebrities all standing to win big when the chips fall this week.

QueensBridge, which was also a backer of Robinhood in 2013 and later Lyft and Dropbox, makes early-stage investments of between $100,000 and $500,000,according toJones’ QueensBridge co-founder Anthony Saleh.
Dividing the firm’s $100,000–$500,000 stake by the share price at the time of Coinbase’s Series B ($1.00676) points to QueensBridge owning around 99,329 shares on the low end or 496,642 on the high end, according to an analysis by CoinDesk.
At the price that Coinbase shares last traded on private secondary markets – $350 per share – Jones’ firm would have a pot of somewhere between $34.76 million and $173.8 million. If Coinbase shares trade at investment bankDA Davidson’s new price target of $440, QueensBridge could see the value of its Coinbase stake rise to $43.7 million and $218.5 million, respectively.
Saleh and Jones did not return requests for comment. Coinbase declined to comment.

But a source familiar with the matter confirmed QueensBridge remains on the Coinbase cap table.
The source added that Jones is a friend of Ben Horowitz, co-founder of Silicon Valley venture giant Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), one of Coinbase’s main backers, who may have told the musician the then-fledglingbitcoinexchange was a promising investment. QueensBridge had raised a $10 million fund in 2012, according to “A-List Angels” author Zack O’Malley Greenburg.
In addition to the well-picked startups QueensBridge backed between 2012 and 2014, Jones and Co. reportedly bagged around$40 millionin 2018 after Amazon acquired the doorbell company Ring.
As well as the Menlo Park mafia of close-knit crypto VCs, Coinbase pulled in some interesting early investors back in the day, including the likes ofthe endowment fund of Duke University(Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam’s alma mater) and angels like former Reuters CEOTom Glocerand former Citigroup CEO Vikram Pandit.
Saleh, now a general partner at VC firm WndrCo, let his feelings about the upcoming Coinbase listing be known in a recent tweet.

Shares ofbitcoinmining machine maker Canaan (Nasdaq: CAN) plummeted after the companyreporteda 75% drop in Q4 revenue on Monday as supply-chain issues prevented the company from capitalizing on a roaring bull market and a resulting surge in demand for mining machines.
“The outbreak of COVID-19 caused supply chain disruptions and thus negatively impacted our revenues in the fourth quarter,” according to CEO Nangen Zhang.For the Q4, the Hangzhou-based firm posted Q4 revenue of $5.9 million,down from $24 million in Q3 of the same year.  Total computing power sold was 0.2 million Thash/s, representing a year-over-year decrease of 93.1% from 2.9 million.The market didn’t respond kindly to the report, with American Depositary Receipts of the maker of ASIC mining machines dropping 34.2%, down $6.41, to 12.25 in recent trading.The company’s adjusted loss, however, narrowed to $11.2 million from $28.6 million as the company reported drops in R&D expense, selling & marketing costs, and general and administrative costs.

Looking ahead, the mining machine maker said it already had $174 million of contracted orders with $66 million of cash advance from customers as of Dec. 31, 2020. The company forecasts at least $61 million in revenue for the ongoing Q1.
Canaan’s supply hangup comes at a time when demand from mining farms couldn’t be higher. North American mining firmsMarathon Patent GroupandBlockcap, for example, are entering 2021 with aggressive plans to expand their hashrates as much as ten fold into 2022. Both Blockcap and Marathon purchased their machines from Canaan rival, Bitmain.
As CoinDeskpreviously reported, the demand has sent prices for machinery soaring on secondary markets.

Continued increases for them seem likely.
While the altcoins outlined in this article are not actually used in any projects that deal with space, their names are in one way or another related to a space object or event.
ATOM has been moving downwards since Feb. 16, when it had reached an all-time high price of $26.55. Since then, it has been trading inside asymmetrical triangle.This was likelywave fourof a long-term bullish impulse which began in March 2020.
On April 11, ATOM managed to break out from this triangle.
A potential target for the top of the upward movement is found at $34.3 and $44.1.
Technical indicators support this upward movement. The RSI has bounced at the 50 line, and theStochastic oscillatorhas made a bullish cross. While theMACDis not yet positive, it has given a bullish reversal signal.
Last week, XLM finally managed to move above the $0.53 resistance area. This is a long-term resistance which is also the 0.5 Fib retracement level of the entire previous downward movement.
The breakout above this level is a strong bullish sign that indicates XLM could continue increasing higher.
Besides the bearish divergence in theRSI, the MACD & Stochastic oscillator support this possibility.
While XLM has been rejected by the 0.618 Fib retracement resistance at $0.66, a breakout above it would take XLM to a new all-time high price.
EGLD has been moving upwards since breaking out from a descending resistance line on March 26. It managed to reach a new all-time high price of $245.8 on April 12.
EGLD seems to be in wave three of a bullish impulse.
While a more accurate target can be determined once wave four is done, the two most likely levels for the top of the move are found at $295 and $360.
Technical indicators in the daily time frame support the continuation of the upward movement towards these levels.
On April 9, WAVES broke out above the $14.60 resistance area and proceeded to reach a high of $20.47 the same day.
WAVES has been decreasing since. However, the drop seems to be a validation of the $14.60 area as support.
If successful, WAVES would be expected to increase once more towards $18.80 and potentially $25.80. Technical indicators support this possibility.
CEL has been moving upwards since its listing.
Beginning on April 2, it increased by 70% in six days. This led to an all-time high price of $7.96 on April 9. CEL has been moving downwards since.
The upward movement resembles a bullish impulse, in which CEL is currently in wave four.
The two main support levels are found at $6.67 and $6.27. These are the 0.382 and 0.5 Fib retracement support levels.
It is likely that CEL finds support at one of these levels before moving upwards once more.
The more bearish scenario would have CEL decreasing to the 0.618 Fib retracement support level at $5.88 before moving upwards.
HOT has been moving upwards at a parabolic rate since March 25. This led to an all-time high price of $0.0316 being reached on April 5.
However, HOT created abearish engulfingcandlestick the next day and has been decreasing since. So far, it has reached the 0.5 Fib retracement support level, found at $0.172.
This is also a horizontal support area, indicating that a bounce is likely.
However, technical indicators have turned bearish. Therefore, while a bounce is expected, HOT may continue to correct afterward.
From Feb. 28 to March 21, LUNA moved upwards parabolically, increasing by 355% in 21 days. The upward movement resembles that of HOT.
This led to an all-time high price of $22.4 being reached. However, LUNA has been moving downward since.
The closest support levels are found at $13.60 and $11.50, the latter also being a horizontal support level.

Highlights:
• Pure is a joint venture company owned equally by LINK and Neptune — sharing equally in costs and crypto based revenues
• The first Pure site will be in Alberta, Canada where LINK operates the majority of its BTC mining operations
• The Pure site will be powered by clean energy sources — Solar, wind, and minimal natural gas
• Focused on development of a Pure carbon credit token or NFT
Neptune’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Cale Moodie, commented: “We are extremely excited with our second foray into Bitcoin mining with Link, and an environmentally sustainably focused operation at that. We see the future of Bitcoin mining to be an environmentally sustainable one and this flagship operation is likely to be the first of many facilities to be developed using green sources.”
Link’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Stephen Jenkins, also commented: “The creation of Pure is the perfect step in the evolution of Link. We have found a like-minded partner in Neptune who understands the value of green energy and sees the same business opportunity in creating a sustainable path for the energy requirements of BTC mining. The Pure 5 MW facility is only the beginning of what we expect will be an innovative and profitable relationship.”

Case in point: shares of Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) have skyrocketed by 377% year-to-date. That’s peanuts, however, compared to its trailing twelve-month gains - all 11,234% of them. No, that’s not a typo.
The thing is, Marathon isn’t even generating any revenue from Bitcoin right now. That’s because it is hoarding all it can accumulate, i.e., it expects Bitcoin’s price to further increase.
The company released a business update last week, detailing its 1Q21 production statistics. The company mined 196 BTC in Q1, of which 102.3 were mined in March. All in all, as of March 31, Marathon held 5,134.2 Bitcoin on the books, including the 4,812.7 BTC purchased in January. At the current price of roughly $60,000 per Bitcoin, this equates to $308 million.
As the March mining figures indicate, Marathon’s ability to mine Bitcoin is only improving. And on this front, its capabilities will only get better.
Among the bulls is H.C. Wainwright analystKevin Dede, who says Marathon has “its paws on the top performing mining machines available in mass production, with claims on all to be manufactured through the March quarter 2022— a full year away.”
The 5-star analyst also notes the company’s strong cash position: “In combination with $212M of cash, Marathon sits well on top of the estimated $160-170M owed on the collection of Bitmain Antminer purchase contracts leading to the company's 103,000 miner fleet that should be up and running by the end of the March quarter next year, the largest in the publicly traded realm of bitcoin miners with which we are familiar.""
Dede is impressed by Marathon’s “sharp operating tactics.” The company has been “savvy” with its purchase agreements, averaging a price of roughly $2,300 per machine, far lower than the range between $7,999 and $18,500 some S19 Pro units have been selling for recently.
Dede also notes Marathon's contract with Beowulf and Two Point One for power costs, which in an all-in arrangement comes in at 3.4 cents per kWh, as further evidence of its deal making prowess.
All in all, Dede keeps a Buy rating on MARA shares. However, due to the constant share gains, Dede’s $50 price target now suggests a limited upside. It will be interesting to see whether the analyst downgrades his rating or raises the price target over the coming months. (To watch Dede’s track record,click here)
Bitcoin miners have yet to attract many reviews from Wall Street’s experts, and Dede remains the sole analyst currently covering Marathon. (See MARA stock analysis on TipRanks)

The answer: A lot.
As a U.S. investor, 25% to 50% of your hard-earned money may go toward taxes, depending on your jurisdiction. That means your tax strategy is every bit as important as your investment strategy.
Related:Apifiny Exchange Network Will Mine Bitcoin to Improve Liquidity Channels
Most governments want to encourage investment, so they offer long-term capital gains incentives. In other words, you pay less tax the longer you hold an asset without selling it.
The U.S. capital gains tax rates are 0%, 15%, or 20%, with most citizens paying 15% for long-term capital gains. In certain countries, tax on capital gains goes down to zero percent, or close to zero percent, rapidly.
A popular strategy for investors is to go for the long-term capital gains incentive on your taxes, which means waiting to reap the benefits from your crypto assets.

There’s only one special tax haven reserved for the largest of crypto whales: Puerto Rico. As an American, moving to Puerto Rico allows you to pay 0% capital gains tax, which means you’ll keep all of your profits on crypto assets.
However, this strategy makes more sense for the whales than the shrimps of the crypto world.
Puerto Rico is America’s tax haven, but the savings you make on your crypto will be diminished by recent spikes in living costs. Due to thebona fide residency requirementto buy a home withintwo yearsunderAct 60-2019, real estate on the island has skyrocketed in price.
Therefore, we encourage this option only if you are a significant crypto whale with the means to buy high and sight unseen in Puerto Rico.
For smaller-scale U.S. investors, moving to a crypto-friendly state with moderate living costs can allow you to live large off your crypto gains, even if you are not a whale.
The key is to drive your income up and your expenses down, and you can do that by choosing a tax-friendly ZIP code and/or lifestyle. As a crypto investor, you want to look at the end-of-year expenses and make some lifestyle choices pronto.
Moving to a state without income tax is a smart tax move and is an attractive option for investors who are able to work remotely. Nine U.S. states haveno income taxas of 2021: Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and Wyoming.
There’s only one special tax haven reserved for the largest of crypto whales: Puerto Rico.
Even if you can’t hack the move to a crypto-friendly state with zero income tax, moving to a ZIP code with lower living costs could save you a bundle on taxes that eat into your crypto gains.
It’s key to remember that if you jack up your lifestyle costs at the same time your income shoots up, then you are no better off except for having more giant toys than you had before.
Moving to an area with low property tax is an obvious way to save big-time.
The second biggest expense is a house, and home-ownership comes with an array of tax implications. Property taxes have risen astronomically in many U.S. states, particularly in California, with people shelling out tens of thousands of dollars a year.
Here’s the thing about a property tax: A property tax is a wealth tax. It’s a tax you have to pay because you have the wealth to own that asset and the amount is arbitrarily determined by ZIP code.
If you were living in Colorado, your property tax on a $350,000 home might be no more than $1,700 for the year. So that starts to look attractive compared to the $10,000-$20,000 property tax each year, say, back in New Jersey.
Someone paying $25,000 a month on property tax in California could have bought another house with the money he or she ends up spending on property taxes in California over 10 years.
So, your property tax address is a key area where you could change your tax picture.
Based on data fromATTOM Data Solutions, states with the lowest effective property tax rates were Hawaii (0.36%), Alabama (0.48%), Colorado (0.52%), Utah (0.56%) and Nevada (0.58%).
Other states in the top 10 for lowest effectiveproperty tax rateswere Tennessee (0.61%); West Virginia (0.61%), Delaware (0.62%), Arizona (0.63%) and Wyoming (0.65%).
Depending on your income level and the state where you live, U.S. crypto investors will end up paying about 33%-40% of their income in both federal and state taxes.
For an American, there are some attractive options to consider when it comes to crossing state lines to avoid high rates of income tax that eat away at your crypto gains.
Your lifestyle is another consideration. You want to be careful about increasing your expenses because you’ll squander the wealth you have.
This is the time to look at your lifestyle costs attached to your ZIP code. If you position yourself to increase your income but keep your living costs low, you will maximize your crypto tax situation.
If you are American wanting to limit your taxes, where and how you live matters. Don’t let your ZIP code stop your crypto assets from taking off.

2021-04-12 20:00:29+00:00,How the Coveted ‘COIN’ Ticker Found Its Way to Coinbase,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coveted-coin-ticker-found-way-200029341.html,CoinDesk,"When Malcolm Palle, chairman of London-listed blockchain investment firm Coinsilium, saw that Coinbase was to begin trading on Nasdaq using the stock ticker “COIN,” it came as something of a surprise.
Back in 2015, Coinsilium became one of the first crypto-focused companies to go public, and the stock now trades on London-based Aquis Exchange (formerly NEX) – using the ticker symbolAQSE: COIN.
Palle says he remains “relatively sanguine” about Coinbase taking the ticker, but added that conversations with the folks at Aquis, and also contacts at the London Stock Exchange, have left him wondering if this was merely overlooked by Coinbase and Nasdaq, and if any resulting confusion will end up being his problem.

“What we would have expected to happen would have been for checks to be made from their end,” Palle said in an interview. “So either they did their checks and they didn’t find us, which I find unbelievable, or they didn’t do their checks and just thought, ‘It’s available on Nasdaq, so we’ll take it.’ Or they did their checks, found us and decided it doesn’t matter, for whatever reason.”
Coinbase declined to comment.
Leaving aside the shades of David and Goliath this situation invites, there are cases where the same tickers exist in different jurisdictions, but not many. Underlying the ticker symbol is the International Securities Identification Number (ISIN), the code that uniquely identifies a specific stock. Where the potential for confusion really arises is with media coverage, not to mention the proliferation of social media, said Palle.
Coinsilium has been a stalwart of the London crypto community since the early days. The firm is recognized in the U.K. through the “COIN” ticker, but when it joined the OTCQB Market in the U.S. in October 2020, its shares were cross-traded under the ticker “CINGF.”
Related:PowerTrade to Launch Bitcoin Options Trading App on Apple Store
Palle pointed out Coinsilium’s holdings have grown rapidly in recent months, and the company is busily pumping out news using the COIN tagin its releases.
“It’s one thing to say there’s a moribund company using the ticker and we’ll never hear from them again. It’s another thing to say we’re going to use that ticker but there’s also a ticker that belongs to a dynamic trading company that’s pumping out news,” Palle said, adding:
“We’re not going to shy away from using the ticker symbol COIN in all our releases.”
Nasdaq declined to comment.
London-listed Coinsilium is not the only firm to have coveted the famous ticker symbol.
InJuly 2014,Gemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss updated their exchange-traded fund (ETF) application, so that it would trade on the Nasdaq under the symbol “COIN.”
Even when the twins laterswitched venuesfor the proposed EFT from Nasdaq to BATS Global Markets, the shares were to be listed under the “COIN” symbol.
Back in 2014, Cameron Winklevoss told CoinDesk in an interview that “identifying the ticker symbol and the exchange are two major events that further demonstrate that we are moving forward as expected.” (Hindsight, etc.)
Gemini declined to comment.

Bitcoin surged early Monday to a four-week high of $61,219.72. Analysts said the largest cryptocurrency might have gotten a boost from the hoopla surrounding U.S. exchange giant Coinbase’s coming direct stock listing Wednesday.
In cryptocurrency circles, the “Coinbase effect” is when a digital token gets a price pump after getting listed on the cryptocurrency exchange. But bitcoin might get the benefit of a different type of “Coinbase effect” – if newbie investors, spurred by mainstream press coverage of the stock listing, decide to put money into cryptocurrencies.
“The Coinbase hype within crypto, in terms of valuation and its domino effect on other markets” means Wednesday’s direct listing might become “a key catalyst event,” Singapore-based crypto quant firm QCP Capital wrote Monday on its Telegram channel.

The cryptocurrency analysis and data site IntoTheBlock wrote in a newsletter last week that “anticipation” of the Coinbase stock listing “has contributed to broader risk-on sentiment throughout crypto.” A week ago, the market value of all cryptocurrenciessurpassed $2 trillion for the first time.
QCP noted that bitcoin prices, despite doubling so far this year, have underperformed the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of large U.S. stocks in the past month, so a successful Coinbase listing might lead to a reversal.
Cryptocurrency analysts also are studying a key blockchain data metric that’s seen as bullish: bitcoin’s liquid supply changes.
According to the analystWilly Woo, more bitcoins are turning from liquid status to illiquid, meaning they’re getting withdrawn and locked away into long-term holding patterns.

That means there might be less supply to go around for new bitcoin buyers, potentially offsetting what appears to have been a recent slackening of demand.

The exchange tokens’ rally in the past month is a “spillover” from Coinbase’s listing, according to QCP, which warned that the fuss surrounding the event could lead to “too much short-term froth” in the crypto market.

Ebix, Inc. (“Ebix” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:EBIX)
Class Period: November 9, 2020 to February 19, 2021
Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 23, 2021
On February 19, 2021, after the market closed, Ebix revealed that its independent auditor, RSM US LLP (“RSM”), resigned “as a result of being unable, despite repeated inquiries, to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence that would allow it to evaluate the business purpose of significant unusual transactions that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2020” related to the Company’s gift card business in India. RSM had also stated that there was a material weakness related to Ebix’s failure to design controls “over the gift or prepaid card revenue transaction cycle sufficient to prevent or detect a material misstatement.” In addition, Ebix and RSM disagreed over the accounting treatment of $30 million that had been transferred into a commingled trust account of Ebix’s outside legal counsel in December 2020.
On this news, the Company’s share price declined by $20.24 per share, or approximately 40%, to close at $30.50 per share on February 22, 2021, on unusually heavy trading volume.
The lawsuit alleges that throughout the Class Period Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that there was insufficient audit evidence to determine the business purpose of certain significant unusual transactions in Ebix’s gift card business in India during the fourth quarter of 2020; (2) that there was a material weakness in the Company’s internal controls over the gift or prepaid revenue transaction cycle; and (3) that the Company’s independent auditor was reasonably likely to resign over disagreements with Ebix regarding $30 million that had been transferred into a commingled trust account of Ebix’s outside legal counsel; and (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

Class Period: December 9, 2019 to February 16, 2021
Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 19, 2021
On February 16, 2021, analyst Wolfpack Research published a research report entitled “EHang: A Stock Promotion Destined to Crash and Burn.” Citing “extensive evidence” including “behind-the-scenes photographs, recorded phone calls, and videos of on-site visits to EH’s various facilities,” the report alleged that EHang is “an elaborate stock promotion, built on largely fabricated revenues based on sham sales contracts with a customer [Shanghai Kunxiang Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd.] who appears to us to be more interested in helping inflate the value of its investment in EH…than about buying its products.” Wolfpack Research also noted that “in just 14 months as a publicly traded company, EH’s PR team has put out 50 press releases…However, EH’s constant stream of press releases are easily proven untrue.” Finally, the report alleged that Wolfpack Research “obtained Chinese court records which show that EH’s ADRs may already be in serious jeopardy due to legal issues in China.”
On this news, the Company’s share price declined by $77.79 per share, or approximately 62.7%, to close at $46.30 per share on February 16, 2021, thereby injuring investors.
The lawsuit alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) the Company’s purported regulatory approvals in Europe and North America for its EH216 were for use as a drone, and not for carrying passengers; (2) its relationship with its purported primary customer is a sham; (3) EHang has only collected on a fraction of its reported sales since its ADS began trading on NASDAQ in December 2019; (4) the Company’s manufacturing facilities were practically empty and lacked evidence of advanced manufacturing equipment or employees; and (5) as a result, Defendants’ statements about its business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked reasonable basis at all relevant times.

Class Period: May 3, 2018 to February 25, 2021
Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 3, 2021
On February 25, 2021, after the market closed, Renewable Energy issued a press release announcing its fourth quarter and full year 2020 financial results. Therein, the Company revealed that it would restate “$38.2 million in cumulative revenue from January 2018 through September 30, 2020” because Renewable Energy was not the “proper claimant for certain BTC payments on biodiesel it sold between January 1, 2017 and September 30, 2020.” Renewable Energy further stated that it had reached an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service “on a $40.5 million assessment, excluding interest” to correct these claims. On this news, the Company’s share price declined by $8.17 per share, or approximately 9.5%, to close at $77.77 per share on February 26, 2021, on unusually heavy trading volume.
The lawsuit alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that due to failures in the diesel additive system, petroleum diesel was not periodically added to certain loads by the Company and was instead added by the Company’s customers; (2) that, as a result, Renewable Energy was not the proper claimant for certain BTC payments on biodiesel it sold between January 1, 2017 and September 30, 2020; (3) that, as a result, Renewable Energy’s revenue and net income were overstated for certain periods; (4) that there was a material weakness in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting related to the purchase and use of the petroleum diesel gallons when blending with biodiesel; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

Class Period: October 2, 2020 to March 2, 2021
Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 7, 2021
On March 3, 2021, Muddy Waters Research published a report entitled “XL Fleet Corp. (NYSE: XL): More SPAC Trash,” alleging, among other things, that salespeople “were pressured to inflate their sales pipelines materially in order to mislead XL’s board and investors” and that “customer reorder rates are in reality quite low” due to “poor performance and regulatory issues.” Citing interviews with former employees, the report alleged that “at least 18 of 33 customers XL featured were inactive.” Muddy Waters also claimed that XL has “weak technology” and that “XL’s announcement of future class 7-8 upfits seems highly promotional” because the task is “too technologically complex for XL engineers to deliver on the promised timeline.” On this news, the Company’s stock price declined by $2.09 per share, or approximately 13%, to close at $13.86 per share on March 3, 2021, on unusually heavy trading volume. The share price continued to decline by $2.69 per share, or approximately 19.4%, over two consecutive trading days to close at $11.17 per share on March 5, 2021, on unusually heavy trading volume.
The lawsuit alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that XL Fleet’s salespeople were pressured to inflate their sales pipelines to boost the Company’s reported sales and backlog; (2) that at least 18 of the 33 customers that XL featured were inactive and had not placed an order since 2019; (3) that XL’s technology had been materially overstated and offered only 5% to 10% of fleet savings; (4) that XL lacks the supply chain and engineers to roll out new products on the announced timelines; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

At the most basic level, the vehicles would give investors a way to bet on the largest cryptocurrency with the ease of buying a stock through a brokerage account. But JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, has identified another potential benefit to the approval of a bitcoin ETF: Helping to normalize the bitcoin futures premium on the Chicago-based CME and other exchanges. The premium represents the difference between the futures-contract price for bitcoin and the current price as traded on major cryptocurrency exchanges. Related: IMF Wants More Crypto Supervision in the Philippines “Launching a bitcoin ETF in the U.S. will be the key to normalizing the pricing of bitcoin futures, in our view,” the U.S. bank’s analysts wrote in an April 9 report, adding that the June contract listed on the CME recently traded at a 25% annualized premium. Read more: What Is a Bitcoin ETF? The gap has increased since February, when it was below 20%. A carry trader could have locked in the 25% annualized premium as profit by buying the cryptocurrency in the spot market and simultaneously selling a June futures contract on the CME. According to the JPMorgan analysts, the wide premium might partly reflect the reality that many big investors have yet to set up accounts or processes to buy cryptocurrencies, or they’re prohibited from doing so under regulations or their own mandates. They’re relegated to gaining exposure through CME futures or the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which has its own drawbacks in terms of pricing irregularities. (Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.) Related: State of Crypto: What Coinbase’s Rise Says to the World So the existence of a physically settled ETF might help to address some of the pricing discrepancies, by bringing extra liquidity into the market. The CME futures are cash-settled to their bitcoin reference rate (BRR) – a daily reference rate of the U.S. dollar price of one bitcoin as of 4 p.m. London standard time (LST). The BRR represents a one-hour volume-weighted average price across a range of major exchanges as of 4 p.m. LST and not a single observational price at 4 p.m. LST. That way, the exchange ensures that a single large trade or cluster of transactions will only have a limited effect on the BRR. However, bitcoin’s volatility is relatively high compared to traditional assets. Hence, the BRR tends to deviate from the spot market price, leading to a tracking error in a carry trade. Story continues “Over a longer horizon, using just Coinbase prices, the monthly tracking error of BRR versus 4 p.m. LST mids has at times been 2% or higher over the past year. Backtesting the performance of basis trades [carry trades] against spot levels as of the same time results in an annualized tracking error of more than 10% over the past year,” JPMorgan analysts noted. “The richness of bitcoin futures likely reflects in part inefficiencies in replicating the BRR to which they settle, particularly without direct access to the spot market.” Last year, the legendary trader Paul Tudor Jones’ investment firm took a bullish bet on bitcoin via the futures market instead of the spot market. While corporate treasury money has been flowing into bitcoin via Coinbase, many regulated funds aren’t allowed to invest through cryptocurrency exchanges. Read more: Coinbase and Bakkt Are Behind Paul Tudor Jones’ Bitcoin Bets, SEC Documents Show “Funds can only access bitcoin via futures on the CME,” Pankaj Balani, co-founder and CEO of the Singapore-based Delta Exchange, told CoinDesk in a WhatsApp call. ”This eventually ends up driving premium on bitcoin futures.” The tracking error could be much lower once a physically settled ETF tied to the spot market price is launched; the risk premium could be priced out. Executing so-called carry trades, also known as basis trades – where investors use hedging transactions to profit from the futures premium – would be much more straightforward and cost-effective with an ETF, possibly resulting in more players and low premiums, according to the JPMorgan report. Also read: Traders Opting for Cash and Carry Strategy as Bitcoin’s ‘Contango’ Widens “At the moment, listed basis trades require ~40% initial margin against the futures position in addition to ongoing variation margin and fully funding the opposing long GBTC positions, making the return on cash noticeably less attractive,” analysts said. Having an ETF would make basis trading “more efficient and attractive at current pricing, particularly if those ETFs can be purchased on margin.” Related Stories JPMorgan Says Bitcoin ETFs Could Shrink CME Futures Premium JPMorgan Says Bitcoin ETFs Could Shrink CME Futures Premium View comments",3,0.75,"The article presents a neutral analysis of the potential impact of Bitcoin ETFs on CME futures premiums, without clear positive or negative implications.",3,0.75,The introduction of Bitcoin ETFs could normalize futures premiums but may also introduce volatility and tracking errors due to the inherent inefficiencies and high volatility of Bitcoin compared to traditional assets.

The report will be of particular interest to cryptocurrency traders, some of whom view bitcoin (BTC) as ahedge against inflationand ongoing currency debasement.
The median forecast calls for a 0.5% month-over-month increase in CPI in March, accelerating slightly from February’s 0.4% clip. Core CPI, which excludes food an energy, is expected to rise by 0.2%, versus a 0.1% rate previously.

Over the past 12 months, the CPI probably rose 2.5%, faster than the 1.7% increase reported last month.
Consumers are already expecting higher inflation as the cost of medical care and home prices rise, according to asurveyby the Federal Reserve Bank of New York conducted in March.
But will the Federal Reserve allow inflation to get too hot before tightening monetary policy? Some analysts think Fed risks falling behind the curve, a possibility traders may adjust to sooner rather than later.
• “The Fed will wait for hard evidence of non-transitory inflation before acting; markets can’t wait for that,” wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
• “Risk is an acceleration in economic growth and inflation of a magnitude economists/the Fed are totally unprepared for,” according to an April 9 report by Bank of America. “In our view, the reality is markets will not wait for the Fed.”
Central banks everywhere are grappling with similar conundrums as the global economy recovers from the deep economic dislocation from the coronavirus.

2021-04-13 00:01:00+00:00,Thorchain Is Ready to Grease the Wheels of Crypto-to-Crypto Trading,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thorchain-ready-grease-wheels-crypto-000100867.html,CoinDesk,"Thorchain, a standalone blockchain for decentralized crypto trading, is set to go live Tuesday, potentially lubricating the gears of a global $2 trillion market six months into a bull run.
Three years in the making (a lifetime in crypto),Thorchainworks a lot like other automated market makers (AMMs) such asBancor and Uniswap, but with an important difference: it enables trades of real cryptocurrencies from completely different blockchains – not “wrapped” or synthetic versions. With each new blockchain that can trade over Thorchain, the so-called “chaosnet” expands.
“April 13 is delivering on the initial promises of the white paper: Delivering on a multichain chaosnet,” Chad Barraford, the technical lead at Thorchain told CoinDesk in a phone call. “You’ll be able to swap freely from one chain to another, one asset to another.”
Related:DeFi Is Transparent, Unless You Look Closely
If it works as intended, users will be able to make such swaps with real currencies (not an ersatz version likewrapped BTCon the Ethereum network) and without having to trust an intermediary. AMMs have been the leading kind ofdecentralized exchange(DEX) that are key to thedecentralized finance (DeFi) boomon Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain.
Bringing trustless trading to many of the biggest chains while skipping the friction of making a copy of a coin on one chain seems likely to drive a lot of activity. Plus, centralized exchanges that hold your assets have a bad habit of losing them.
The Thorchain launch is also a reminder of the long-termcompetitive threatDEXs pose to centralized venues like Coinbase ahead of that company’s hotly-anticipated stock listing.
Thorchain will start by allowing trades of bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC), bitcoin cash (BCH) and Binance Chain’s BNB. More will come shortly. For example, Barraford said the code for dogecoin (DOGE) is basically ready.
Related:The NFT Craze Is Helping Nigerian Artists Go Global
For details about which cryptocurrencies have been scoped out for addition, interested readers can look at Thorchain’s regular technical updateson Medium.
Thorchain is based on Tendermint, the consensus protocol associated with the Cosmos ecosystem.
Thorchain uses a mechanic that’s very similar to thatpioneered by Bancor. Sticking with the mythological motif, the native token of Thorchain is known RUNE. Every token in Thorchain is matched with an equal amount in value of its RUNE token.
When a user initiates a trade between, say, BCH and LTC, under the hood it becomes two trades. First, the user trades BCH for RUNE and then the RUNE gets traded for LTC. Provided it’s all done quickly, this should work out to basically the same thing as swapping directly between BCH and LTC.
Bancor does this with its BNT token. Uniswap, in its first version, paired every ERC-20 token it listed with ETH, thoughin version 2.0, Uniswap became a lot more flexible, enabling pairs of any two tokens.
Unlike Bancor or Uniswap, however, Thorchain is capable of trading the real assets of multiple unconnected blockchains, not representations of them.
“If you want to swap layer-1 real bitcoin with layer-1 real ETH, you can do it,” Baraford said. The team is developing an Asgard X wallet that will be built to interact directly with Thorchain and all its included blockchains, so it can store the coins from those networks.
Cosmos has alreadylaunched inter-blockchain communication(or IBC) and Thorchain will integrate with that soon, which will enable it to add many more blockchains. In its most recentdeveloper update, the team reported that “a development partner has been found and will begin building IBC bridges”
While Thorchain’s functionality is not live, its token is available and traded. As of this writing, it’s trading at around $11.20, up almost 90% in the last 30 days,according to CoinGecko.
Thorchain has been around a long time. The first version was started and largely abandoned in 2018, according to Barraford.
Since then, a cryptographic innovation known asthreshold signatureshave been invented and the Cosmos ecosystem has developed much more fully. In 2019 the fundamental idea of trustless exchange between blockchains was revised and redeveloped to incorporate these advances in the technology.
“In a threshold, you have multiple people coming together to make a single signature without anyone having access to the private key,” Baraford explained.
The team that came together around building Thorchain decided to stay largely anonymous and to avoid attention as much as possible.
The core team has a stated goal of disbanding in summer of 2022 and turning everything over to RUNE holders.
Like on any AMM, the project needs liquidity providers to get involved in order to work as effectively as possible. If there are few parties willing to buy or sell an asset, the final price of a trade can vary widely from the participants’ expectations. The deeper each pool is, the less suchslippagethere will be any trade. Users can post an equal amount of any token it covers and RUNE to the system and start earning trading fees.
“You can provide bitcoin into the network and that bitcoin can earn a bitcoin yield,” Baraford said.
Thorchain also addresses an issue for those who supply liquidity to networks, known as impermanent loss. That is, if the value of one token in a pool goes down relative to the other, the value of their deposit can shrink in fiat terms even though their total deposit in the underlying tokens is increasing.
“One of the important things about this network is it has impermanent loss protection,” Barraford said. As long as you stay in 100 days.
That said, Barraford noted that there’s seldom impermanent loss when liquidity providers stay in that long. However, Thorchain effectively takes a snapshot of the value of any liquidity deposit. If the user’s fiat value has fallen below where it was when they deposited due to rebalancing, Thorchain will make up for it out of RUNE reserves.
Liquidity providers will also earn new RUNE emissions on their deposit. “The amount of RUNE that goes into each pool is dependent on how much revenue has come from that pool in that block,” Barraford said. The freshest RUNE goes to the most active pools.
Very nearly all of the RUNE reserves will be distributed in the first two years of operation.
Multicoin Capital released a report on Thorchainin February, noting that the Austin-based investment firm has a major position in its RUNE token. The co-authors wrote:
“Most investors have exposure to the blockchains they think will win; however, few actually have exposure to the growing heterogeneity of the overall ecosystem. … [W]e believe THORChain’s RUNE token is the best way to invest in this thesis.”
